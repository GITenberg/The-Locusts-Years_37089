</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a man has reached the point where he can reflect,
with cynical satisfaction, upon the brutality of organized society, and
can contemplate unmoved one of its victims; and when the cause of his
reflections is a woman not over thirty, whose worth and refinement are
obvious to any reader of faces, that man either must possess a
coarse-grained and cruel nature, or he must be very highly
civilized.</p>
<p>No shade of doubt could have entered Judge Alexander Barton&rsquo;s
mind as to which of these adjectives applied to him. He would have
repudiated the faintest hint that a taint of coarseness or cruelty
could lie in him. His was one of those eminent political personalities
which bubble up from the great caldron of American democracy. He had
convictions and principles of a high order. They appeared frequently in
the shape of addresses to young men&rsquo;s political and reading
clubs, or in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>&ldquo;few remarks&rdquo; at church socials, where
a programme of songs and recitations was followed by the distribution
of home-made cakes and candies, and of uninspiriting beverages. It was
sometimes remarked of him in that other world which he frequented that
his conscientiousness in attending these mild-flavored symposia was the
indisputable evidence of his fitness to adorn the roster of the
Philippine judiciary. For to whom may we look for an example, if not to
the interpreters of the law, whose position vests them with dignity,
social and official? From whom may we demand the utterance of lofty
principles and of high convictions, if not from the very men whose
business it is to punish the unhappy wretches whose actions have
declared <i>their</i> principles, expressed or otherwise, of the
flimsiest?</p>
<p>Judge Barton was also frequently extolled as the pattern of American
democracy, as, indeed, he was. Nothing could have been more catholic
than his handshake, nothing more finely measured than the appreciation
which it conveyed of the recipient&rsquo;s relation to himself: to the
veteran of the Army of the Philippines, it was hearty, and bespoke the
comrade in arms; to the struggling young civil-service employee,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>it was encouraging, and it hinted, ever so
delicately, that the inspiration for great ambitions ought to lie in
the example of living statesmen; to the clergy and to the members of
the Educational Department, who fairly swarm in the Philippines, it was
fraternal and spoke confidentially of the tie which linked them in a
great work; and to the effervescing spume from the Pacific coast, which
is knocking about Manila, loud in vituperation of the change from
democratic to bureaucratic society&mdash;to that segment of Young
America whose disposition to criticise existing institutions led to the
happy phrase &ldquo;undesirable citizens&rdquo;&mdash;the Judge&rsquo;s
democratic cordiality always embodied a hope that their mutual
relations might continue forever harmonious, and it even intimated that
no act on his part could make them otherwise.</p>
<p>The cause of the Judge&rsquo;s highly civilized musings was one of
those undesirable citizens of the feminine gender; and, if you ask how
anything proper in the feminine gender may be classed as an undesirable
citizen, there can only be cited an opinion from the Judge
himself&mdash;one of those <i>ex-cathedra</i> sentiments which he held
as infallible&mdash;that any one who refuses to accept pleasantly a
situation which he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span>is powerless to remedy, and who continues a
quarrel which is futile and which can result only disastrously to its
single champion, that person is, primarily, inefficient, and,
secondarily, insane; either of which states is undesirable.
Furthermore, there is nothing so repellent to a man as the feminine
weakness which enlists his sympathy, and, at the same time, challenges
the terms on which it is given. To find the shivering wretch on whom
you would bestow an alms repudiating your charity and mutely
reproaching you for the condition of things which makes you donor and
him recipient&mdash;in such a metaphor, perhaps, the Judge might have
condensed the musings which a month&rsquo;s illness and the daily
opportunity of studying Miss Ponsonby had bred.</p>
<p>The young woman who had received so much of His Honor&rsquo;s
valuable consideration did not look a very formidable antagonist in a
quarrel with organized society. She stood at an open window of the
hospital, gazing down on a convalescent-strewn lawn, where a military
band was delighting the sick with a Christmas Eve concert. Her tall
figure was very slender&mdash;so slender, in fact, as to make it quite
evident that the blue cotton nurse&rsquo;s dress which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>she wore
was the survival of a plumper epoch. She was not a beautiful woman, nor
was she even a pretty one, though she was far from being ugly. Her eyes
were gray and kind, with well arched brows. Her nose was slightly
aquiline, with sensitive nostrils. A rather low forehead, a broad
mouth, and a shapely head covered with brown hair, were attributes
which she shared with any number of women. What particularly marked her
was a delicate grace of manner, an emanation of fastidiousness in every
glance and movement, a reserve which at times became almost stiffness;
in short, a distinction which, in happier circumstances, might have
made her envied, but which in the mixture of a pioneer community served
only to isolate her.</p>
<p>For at least two weeks of convalescence, Judge Barton had amused
himself with the attempt to determine why Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s charm
and distinction should be assets of so little practical value to her.
His decision was that, in appearance most distinguished, she was
singularly lacking in the unconscious self-confidence which usually
accompanies distinction; that, a most feminine creature in many
respects, she was unfemininely distrustful of her power over men. There
was, in her perfectly dignified <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>attitude toward the other sex,
and in the absence of all coquetry, a sort of proud abdication of
feminine rights. She resigned all a woman&rsquo;s natural claim upon
man&rsquo;s emotional nature; and the keen analyst who had studied her
so closely fancied that he could detect a repressed challenge of
man&rsquo;s superiority. He classified her (with a kind of shrugging
pity) as one of those women of whom all men speak respectfully and many
men admiringly, but who grow old and plain and bitter, unsought among
their more frivolous sisters. At the same time, he admitted an
attraction which had kept him bidding indirectly for her notice.</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s impassive reserve with men was so wholly a
confession, and, at the same time, so proud a disclaimer of the usual
meek attitude of unpopular women, that it not only irritated the man
who could analyze her, but it provoked his curiosity and led him into
attempt after attempt to sting her into speech and unconscious
revelations. And whenever he did so and retired, foiled, with the
consciousness of having given an unmanly stab to weakness, his
man&rsquo;s desire to think well of himself made him put the blame upon
her.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of that particular day, Miss <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>Ponsonby&rsquo;s feminine characteristics were in
possession. She leaned rather languidly against the window frame, and
her bodily fatigue, and a self-conscious forlornness which she strove
habitually to conceal, were quite evident. Every movement betrayed the
woman pushed beyond her strength; every sensitive, quivering line of
her face hinted at emotions rioting under a repressed exterior.</p>
<p>If her very apparent dejection aroused no compunction in the Judge
(he being so highly civilized) it evoked an ardent sympathy from the
young man in the next bed; for, in those days, not even the potency of
a Judge&rsquo;s title could have commanded a private room in the
hospital. As a next best expedient, Judge Barton had been placed in a
small room opening from the main ward, and containing but two beds. The
exigencies of an overcrowded surgical ward made it necessary that the
second bed should be occupied by a young pearl fisher, with a crushed
chest, who had been taken off a wrecked lorcha. His magnificent
physique, and the face of a Greek statue, would have lured from a woman
a more complimentary description than the term &ldquo;young
ruffian&rdquo; which Judge Barton had instantly but inaudibly fastened
upon him. &ldquo;Young ruffian&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>is perhaps an exaggerated
phrase to describe the beauty and <i>insouciance</i> which, in a male,
may be qualified by a hat too far on one side. The Judge had never seen
Collingwood in his hat, but he divined just the angle which the young
man&rsquo;s taste approved.</p>
<p>Collingwood was gradually recovering, but he was still unable to
move without the assistance of a nurse or of one of the Filipino
attendants. He had the black hair, the pink and white skin, and, the
cameo-cut profile of a Celtic ancestry, modified by his father&rsquo;s
union with a woman of Tennessee pioneer stock. His eyes, which should
have been the Irishman&rsquo;s blue, were a steadfast brown. His frame
was a little more massive than his father&rsquo;s had been; the
Irishman&rsquo;s blarney had merged into the chaff of the Westerner;
but enough of Irish humor remained to lend flavor to the practical,
hard-headed sense which he had inherited from the mountaineer side of
the family. His speech was cheery and careless, yet shrewd; lacking in
polish, yet not uncouth. He was not uneducated, and took an innocent
satisfaction in having credentials to show for that fact, being a
graduate of a small high-school in one of the Middle States. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>Judge had found him a not uninteresting companion,
for he was outspoken, a born lover of adventure, and a born
money-maker, if the Judge ever knew one.</p>
<p>However, Collingwood himself interested Judge Barton far less than
did the growth of an emotion in the young man which the dignitary had
covertly watched enlarge from an expansive gratitude to absorbing
affection. The &ldquo;young ruffian&rdquo; had fallen head over ears in
love with a woman whose critical faculties and fastidious instincts
might well have shaken the courage of a more pretentious suitor; and he
enjoyed the ruffian&rsquo;s usual advantage of being sensitive to
material difficulties only. If he felt the distinction in Miss
Ponsonby&rsquo;s manner, it was not as something which separated her
from him, but as something which made her only more desirable. He
mistook her reserve for shyness; her proud detachment, for meekness. He
was aflame to seize the woman who not only appealed to his senses, but
who stirred ambitions of which he was hardly conscious, and to bear her
away from her overtasked life. He wished to play King Cophetua to the
beggar maid; and he was saved from appearing supremely ridiculous only
by his sincerity and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18"
name="pb18">18</a>]</span>by freedom from all self-consciousness in his
desire.</p>
<p>It was so natural that a young ruffian should fall in love with
probably the first gentlewoman with whom he had come into frequent
association, that the Judge wasted no particular attention on
Collingwood&rsquo;s side of the case. What really interested that
gentleman was Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s attitude. For, as he put it to
himself, there was a woman with an undeniable personality, engaged in a
dumb squabble with society because she could not obtain a recognition
of that personality; and the only admirer and partisan she could muster
was a young ruffian so far removed from atmospheric influences that he
had not recognized that she was a personality; a man who would not have
known what was meant by the word. She might have been the young woman
who despatches telegrams from the lobby of a first-class hotel, so far
as Collingwood&rsquo;s assumption that she belonged to his world was
concerned. Her nurse&rsquo;s apron and cap were to him the indisputable
evidences of his right to claim her for his friend or for his
sweetheart, provided, of course, that the attraction was mutual; and
that her taste might be influenced by any other standard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>than his
own, he had no suspicion. Judge Barton had even detected at times the
tacit overture for a class combination, the assumption that they of the
toilers needed no chance civility from one temporarily thrown into
their society. That the situation daily developing under his observant
eyes must be humiliating to Miss Ponsonby, Judge Barton had not the
least doubt. But he was sufficiently human to hope that the hour of
Collingwood&rsquo;s discomfiture (for of that also he had no doubt)
might be delayed until he, the Judge, was ready to leave the hospital,
and to find some other amusement than that of watching a proud
woman&rsquo;s struggle with her femininity.</p>
<p>Collingwood, quite unconscious of the Judge&rsquo;s observant eye,
lay watching Miss Ponsonby with an alertness which contrasted strangely
with his maimed body. There was, in his slightly dilated nostril and in
the glow of his eye, the suggestion of a horse which pricks forward its
ears and accelerates its pace as it nears home; and perhaps some latent
instinct of domesticity lay at the bottom of the man&rsquo;s rather
inexplicable fancy for Miss Ponsonby.</p>
<p>It was inexplicable, not only through the social gulf which actually
divided them, but through the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>fact that she had never been a
man&rsquo;s woman, and that all Collingwood&rsquo;s previous
attachments had been for the type of woman who is adored by the
opposite sex. Miss Ponsonby was not diffident under his advances, nor
was she overwhelmed by a man&rsquo;s favor, little as she had enjoyed
of it. Attention of a sort she had had, because the position of the
relatives who had brought her up was such that any member of their
household had to be taken into consideration; but from the time she had
left the shelter of their roof, she had received from men an
indifference as profound as it was respectful. Collingwood&rsquo;s very
open admiration was the first tracery upon a page which was
humiliatingly blank.</p>
<p>It had begun&mdash;his admiration&mdash;on his first night in the
hospital, when he lay a bandaged mummy, racked with pain, a mounting
fever adding its torments to the closeness of a muggy, tropical night.
There were memories of its sufferings mingled with gentle
ministrations, of touches soothing to his worn body, of a feeling of
helplessness and dependence upon this gentleness, which carried him
back to his half-forgotten childhood, and washed, as clean as his
school-boy&rsquo;s slate, a philosophy of life acquired in numerous
love affairs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>with the young ladies of hotel lobbies, and of
restaurant check stands.</p>
<p>The impression remained overnight and increased by reason of the
succession of another nurse, who prided herself upon her jollity, and
believed that her patients needed cheering up. Collingwood was in such
a condition that jollity was an affront to him. He endured the cheerful
lady as best he could, and counted the long hours till four
o&rsquo;clock brought back his madonna.</p>
<p>The word had no part in Collingwood&rsquo;s vocabulary; but it is
applicable because it expresses the quality of worship which he had
injected into an otherwise very mundane emotion. Collingwood, who was
as innocent as a babe of social traditions, who was an American
democrat through and through, and believed that all men are equal, save
as the possession of &ldquo;the price&rdquo; enables one man to command
more of this world&rsquo;s goods than another, was unable to account
for the elements in Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s nature which whetted his
desires, by any of the threads which contributed to the fabric of his
philosophy; and he explained them by imputing to the lady the rare and
peculiar quality of goodness.</p>
<p>Goodness! There you have the weak point in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>arch of
man&rsquo;s philosophical structure, the thing which at once embodies
his highest ideal and his most human distaste, the thing over which he
has rhapsodized in poetry, which he has exalted into a theology, and
which he has ruthlessly crucified whenever he has met it in the flesh.
Collingwood supposed that Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s delicate rejection of
his advances (a rejection qualified by some feeling which a
lover&rsquo;s instinct had to interpret to his advantage) originated in
goodness, in a final struggle of the etherealized feminine nature
before it submitted to its incarnation and became bound in the flesh.
He thought the delicate self-restraint with which she met the caprices
and fretfulness of her wards was founded on heavenly patience. He
imagined that her occasional snubs of Judge Barton were the
outcroppings of an inward shrinking from a passion to which she could
not respond; for, loverlike, he assumed that all men must feel as he
did about his divinity and he could not perceive the undercurrent of
patronage in the Judge&rsquo;s not infrequent gallantries, which was
like an acid on Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s quivering nerves.</p>
<p>It was a delicious situation. Judge Barton rubbed his hands in
enjoyment of it, and you must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>admit that he had some justification
in the lady&rsquo;s persistent refusal to make the best of his somewhat
generous efforts to establish friendly relations. Oh, yes, it was a
delicious situation; and the only one element in it which the Judge
never suspected was that secret response to the young man&rsquo;s
tenderness which the lover himself had divined, which whetted him in
spite of studied rebuffs, and which, his alleged democracy
notwithstanding, all Judge Barton&rsquo;s class instincts would have
unhesitatingly pronounced unseemly&mdash;as, indeed, the young woman
herself regarded it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"

<p class="first">Charlotte Ponsonby continued to lean against the
window in an abstraction which registered impressions very much as a
flagellant&rsquo;s ecstasy may note the pathway of his torment. The
consciousness of her own perturbation made it exceedingly difficult to
turn around. She was so unhappy that it seemed the fact must be evident
to even a casual observer. She was afraid of a kindly word, or of a
mere friendly glance, lest it should break through the self control she
had been exerting.</p>
<p>When at length the National Anthem had been played, and lucent amber
was fading into early dusk, the nurse had no further excuse for turning
her back on the two patients in her ward. She did not glance at them as
she moved away, but her quick return with a glass of milk showed that
one of them, at least, was in her thoughts. She offered the refreshment
to Collingwood with an explanation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25"
href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>in a dry, professional tone, for
its being three minutes late.</p>
<p>He sipped it, looking over the rim with his steadfast brown
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; he said fretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you must be. I will move you when you have finished
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Judge Barton mused, &ldquo;if nurses do not
sometimes feel like saying &lsquo;So am I&rsquo; when we fellows
complain of being tired, or nervous, or out of patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby threw him a smile of recognition for the courtesy of
the thought. &ldquo;Very often they do,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but
that thought would not come in the case of Mr. Collingwood, because he
<i>is</i> tired, and we know that he suffers. Nurses seldom think of
themselves so long as they can reasonably think of their
patients.&rdquo; Her outstretched hand conveyed an intimation to the
patient under discussion that he was taking an unusual time to consume
a glass of milk.</p>
<p>Collingwood was not a man to be hurried when he had an object in
taking time. He affected not to see her hand, when, in reality, he
wanted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>caress it; and he continued to sip his milk very
slowly indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas Eve,&rdquo; he said lugubriously, &ldquo;a bum
Christmas if ever there was one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Judge Barton. &ldquo;Collingwood has an
epoch now in life&mdash;a landmark. Hereafter he will class all events
as before or after the Christmas he spent in hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i>,&rdquo; Collingwood threw at him, &ldquo;you
can afford to smile. You have plenty of friends. It&rsquo;s not the
same with you as with a poor devil like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; expostulated the Judge,
&ldquo;&lsquo;at night all cats are gray.&rsquo; Friends do not make a
Christmas. When one is away from one&rsquo;s home and family at this
season, there are no gradations. Ask Miss Ponsonby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Miss Ponsonby, what he says?&rdquo; inquired
Collingwood with the air of one appealing to an infallible
tribunal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Collingwood. Judge Barton must look
for his support to someone who has passed through both experiences. I
have passed Christmas away from my family, but I have not passed one
surrounded by a host of friends.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you understand so much,&rdquo; the Judge murmured.
Irritated by her unresponsiveness, he grew almost impertinent.
&ldquo;The keenness of your intelligence is only excelled by your
kindness of heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s cheek for an instant flew danger signals, but
she said nothing. She looked at the Judge a moment and subdued him.
Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe you give me credit for any great kindness of
heart,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then must I give you credit for the patience of
Job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you may do.&rdquo; She took the glass from Collingwood,
who, after an ineffectual effort to convince himself that it was not
empty, yielded it reluctantly.</p>
<p>The Judge, with a delicacy which he practised with almost ceremonial
observance, turned on his pillow and gave them the benefit of a wealth
of grizzled black hair, covering a massive head. He would not intrude
upon the act of changing the young man&rsquo;s wearied posture. His
excess of delicacy robbed the act of its naturalness, made it seem
personal and intimate.</p>
<p>Collingwood felt the nurse&rsquo;s hesitation. His <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>heart
thumped in glad triumph. Let her rule her manner as she would, she
could not make that service impersonal. He saw her teeth catch her
underlip as she bent over him. Her eyes would not meet his, which glued
themselves appealingly upon her face. She slipped her arm under him,
however, while his own went about her neck.</p>
<p>In spite of her care, and the perfect training of her action, the
slight change which she made in his position wrenched a groan from him.
Yet as she laid him back and still stooped, drawing her arms from under
him, his own clinging arms tightened, and he pressed his lips ardently
against the cheek so near his own.</p>
<p>For a breath, the very shortest breath a man ever drew, he could
have sworn he felt a response to the caress, a womanly yielding to all
that affection and dependence may imply. Then her eyes, startled, met
his, and on the heels of a fawn-like timidity, a wave of fierceness
sent the red blood dyeing her cheek, set the high arched nostril
aquiver. The intuition flashed into his brain that it was the first
man&rsquo;s caress which had ever touched her soft cheek, and that she
was no less frightened than indignant. The joy of the thought drove his
blood leaping and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29"
name="pb29">29</a>]</span>stifled his cry of protest, as she drew
hurriedly back and left him. She moved rapidly toward the corridor,
whence the babble of a woman&rsquo;s voice, which grew louder as the
owner advanced, came floating in.</p>
<p>The lady, weighted with flowers, who had come to bring the
season&rsquo;s remembrances to the suffering dignitary, had paid him
several previous visits, was known to Charlotte, and was an object of
no little curiosity to Collingwood. She was a member of a very
fashionable set, and bore its stamp in dress and mannerisms. She was
tall and large-boned, with an ugly, intense face framed in a mass of
the then fashionable chestnut-red hair. Save for its haughty demand for
consideration, her countenance was not unlike those of her fallen
sisters in the suburbs of Manila. There were the same suggestions of
life drained to the dregs, the challenge, the hard look about the eyes.
She had the manner of an actress, a kind of studied, feline grace which
fell into postures and left the observer in doubt whether her next move
would be a purr or the stroke of a treacherous paw.</p>
<p>The lady took Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s hand and held it during the
course of several honeyed utterances. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>Yet the effect of her
courtesy was an impression not of kindness, but of insolence. She
managed to convey the idea that civility to one&rsquo;s inferiors is an
attribute of a great lady, and that she was living up to the demands of
her position. When she passed to the bedside of the afflicted one,
however, a warmth, a glow of the magnetism which she could exert
diffused itself like an essence in the bare, ugly room. She addressed
the Judge in the abusive strain of intimacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fraudulent creature!&rdquo; she reproached him,
&ldquo;lying here, pretending to be ill when I want you at my
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lady, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The Judge gestured away the
phantom of that dinner. Being shut out of paradise, he could not talk
of its glories.</p>
<p>Mrs. Badgerly laughed in his face. Then she looked around the room
for the nurse. She wished her flowers arranged just <i>so</i> in the
bowl of old Chinese bronze which her husband and she hoped would keep
them green in a dear friend&rsquo;s memory. Would Miss Ponsonby put
them in one by one as she directed? She herself was afraid of ruining
her frock, which had already led to recrimination between herself and
her husband. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You do it beautifully, you know,&rdquo; she purred, as the
nurse&rsquo;s deft fingers planted sprays of green and white.
&ldquo;You must not mind my comments. I am supposed to be a
critic&mdash;really competent. I took lessons in Japan. Nothing is so
satisfying as to lie face down on the floor, sticking cherry blossoms
into a Satsuma vase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Japan,&rdquo; remarked Judge Barton, &ldquo;have
those silks which you promised to get for me come yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to mention those silks. They are on a navy
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smuggling again,&rdquo; said the Judge. &ldquo;I believe you
women do it for the sake of intrigue. You will never rest till you have
gotten some poor wretch cashiered and have driven me off the bench. I
did not mind the duty, and I do mind the delay. Why didn&rsquo;t you
have them sent down by mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> mind the duty. I shall oppose it on principle
whenever I can. I delight in evading customs duties. It is the greatest
pleasure I have in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badgerly votes a Republican ticket, doesn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ticket he votes is immaterial. So is what you say. Would
you find <i>me</i> guilty and sentence <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>me to imprisonment if I
came up for trial in your august court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt I should cast about for extenuating
circumstances, though you would not deserve my doing so. So I am to be
the purveyor of smuggled goods, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you are too holy&mdash;&rdquo; she rippled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I hope I don&rsquo;t set up for being holy. I should
almost prefer the title of smuggler. Still, in my position, it might
look awkward. However, I&rsquo;ve always been a pliant fool in a
woman&rsquo;s hands, and I haven&rsquo;t the backbone to rise up and
protest. If you are determined to smuggle, I suppose you must, but
don&rsquo;t tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you politicians do juggle with your consciences,&rdquo;
she retorted. &ldquo;You would have liked me so much better if I
hadn&rsquo;t told you. You would have known, but you could have
pretended not to.&rdquo; She glanced up in time to catch a flicker of
distaste in Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s eyes, as that lady hastily withdrew
them after a covert scrutiny of the Judge. &ldquo;But how I run
on!&rdquo; she declared flippantly. &ldquo;I am afraid we are shocking
your good nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Miss Ponsonby took note of the condescension in Mrs.
Badgerly&rsquo;s choice of adjectives, she did not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>betray
the fact. She quite repudiated any inclination to be shocked.
&ldquo;You could not do it,&rdquo; she declared ambiguously, planting
the last spray.</p>
<p>Mrs. Badgerly took Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s measure deliberately. She
had long before admitted the personality. She now divined the quarrel.
It gave her a rapturous moment of triumph to realize that there was a
woman pulled down by the weight of material circumstances which buoyed
<i>her</i> up. The full flavor of her insolence rioted in her blood.
What was character, what was personality, to power?</p>
<p>She carried a swagger stick of Philippine <i>camagon</i> wood,
tipped with a rare piece of Chinese ivory carving. She swung one knee
over the other, revealing a mass of dainty petticoats, and silken hose,
and a pair of high-heeled slippers. She lolled back, her keen face
supported by one slender gloved hand, while she swished her voluminous
draperies with the swagger stick. Even Judge Barton, who knew her so
well, was stunned by her audacity. He felt as if each blow were a lash
on the shoulders of the woman facing her, who had turned to leave them.
He felt that Mrs. Badgerly wanted them so interpreted. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So glad you are not narrow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Badgerly
suavely, &ldquo;I hate cats, old feminine cats. I lunched with six of
them yesterday. I tried to propitiate them. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been just
as bad as bad can be,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but I am not going to be so
any more. I&rsquo;m going to be good as gold from now on. I&rsquo;ve
even told my husband so.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused to let the full audacity of her remarks sink into her
auditors&rsquo; minds. Judge Barton held his breath. It was a masterly
inspiration to flaunt her impudence in the other&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;What is your purity worth? your delicacy? your refinement? your
fastidiousness?&rdquo; she seemed to exult. &ldquo;Will they win you
notice or consideration? You are not the companion, the friend of this
man; I am that. You are his menial. What does his secret opinion of
either of us matter? His deference is for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Badgerly, still blocking Miss
Ponsonby&rsquo;s way with her theatrically shod feet. &ldquo;I made my
little confession&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it dear of me?&mdash;in public,
and they looked shocked. Nothing is more vulgar than to be shocked.
They sat and stared at one another in helpless bewilderment. They had
not a word to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Mrs. Badgerly felt that the helpless indignation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>of six
ladies whose commercial and official relations with her husband through
the medium of their husbands had to be supported by civility to his
wife; if she felt that their action formed any precedent for the young
woman in a nurse&rsquo;s cap and apron, she made her first error then
and there. The very faintest suggestion of contempt swept across Miss
Ponsonby&rsquo;s aristocratic features. She made a little forward
movement, just sufficient to force Mrs. Badgerly to draw back her
French slipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they did not believe you,&rdquo; she said gently;
&ldquo;and, as they could not possibly say so, there was nothing else
to be said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snigger with which Collingwood received this (he had been
listening, but it was Mrs. Badgerly&rsquo;s fault, she pitched her
voice too high) was drowned in an exclamation from the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-ha, Mrs. Badgerly, there you have your <i>riposte</i>. You
must not try fencing with Miss Ponsonby. Did I not tell you long ago
that she was clever, far too clever for you or me? But she is kind,
too. She is too generous to take you at your word, though she does not
mind countering with you for the pure skill of it.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s response was a somewhat drawn smile as she moved
away. Mrs. Badgerly, though taken aback, was not routed. She still felt
that the sinews of war were in her hands, and, until the close of her
visit, she made a series of demands upon the nurse which could not
courteously be refused, but which kept that unfortunate always waiting
upon her. She reserved a few arrows till her departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear nurse,&rdquo; she said, laying a hand on Miss
Ponsonby&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;I have been a dreadful nuisance, but I
<i>must</i> be forgiven. People are so good to me. They always do
forgive me. You will&mdash;I know you will. You look so tired, dear
nurse. Won&rsquo;t you let me send the carriage for you some evening
when I am not going out? I am sure you ought to be rewarded in Heaven
for the sacrifices you make on earth. Are you always occupied at this
hour?&mdash;the only time when Manila is agreeable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Collingwood, who was even more obtuse than the generality of
men in matters where women&rsquo;s <i>finesse</i> is concerned, took
these feminine taunts at their face value. They moderated the
resentment which, at first, the obvious prosperity and self-confidence
of the visitor had aroused. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37"
href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>had anathematized her with the
favorite adjective of democracy: he had mentally labelled her
&ldquo;stuck up.&rdquo; But the tenor of the conversation went far to
remove that impression. Its delicate thrusts, its cruel taunts, he
missed; but the unvarnished effrontery of it reminded him, save for a
flavor of smartness which he relished but could not define, of the
frankness of some of the young ladies who had contributed to his
discarded philosophy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he gloried somewhat inconsistently in Miss
Ponsonby&rsquo;s ill concealed reprobation. Her spunkiness (his own
word, dear reader) delighted him as a further evidence of that holiness
which was essential to his madonna. The remembrance of his stolen kiss
flowed back to him, and he lay alternately quaking and enraptured at
the thought of his own boldness.</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby put aside Mrs. Badgerly&rsquo;s thanks and declined
her carriage. She went about her evening duties with a kind of startled
grace like some nerve-tense creature, ready to leap at a sound. Not a
single glance fell Collingwood&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>But at nine o&rsquo;clock, when lights were to go out, the necessity
of administering medicine to Judge Barton made her bear down on their
little ward with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>a tray. She was very self-possessed, so much so
that the keen man of the world guessed that her late encounter had been
more trying than she was willing for him to know.</p>
<p>Still, the motive which made him utter a word or two of apology for
his guest was not wholly kind. Miss Ponsonby had snubbed his friend,
and to do that was to impugn the greatness of the man himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that my caller gave you a great deal of
trouble,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Charlotte smiled. &ldquo;It mattered little. I am here for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal of trouble,&rdquo; he repeated, detaining her by
holding his medicine untasted. &ldquo;But, as she said, she must be
forgiven. Ah! there is nothing so perfect as the assurance of spoiled
women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That hurt. It drew a contrast. She, Charlotte Ponsonby, was not
spoiled, and she had no assurance, and he could not forgive her for it.
Pain jarred an injudicious reply from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are they spoiled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lady! Why is the earth scattered with the records of
man&rsquo;s folly? Because he <i>feels</i>, and they prey upon his
miserable feelings. I am <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=
"#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>not sure that you are mundane enough
to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not certain that I do understand. But I am certain that
my stupidity does not originate in any ultramundane flights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re clever,&rdquo; said the Judge,
&ldquo;dangerously clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No woman is dangerously clever till she uses her wits for
evil purposes,&rdquo; she said, flushing. &ldquo;I resent your choice
of adjectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I was thinking of
the effect of your cleverness upon yourself, not upon others, and I
cannot retract. It is dangerous for any woman&rsquo;s happiness to
analyze herself and all the world as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little shrug, and held out her hand for the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear with me,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I am not sleepy, and
you wish to turn out the lights and leave me in the darkness to ponder
my sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my solemn duty to turn them out at once if you are
going to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I protest. Hold on just a minute, and I&rsquo;ll swallow the
nauseous stuff. Seriously, Miss Ponsonby, don&rsquo;t you
think&mdash;all advantages and disadvantages <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>taken
into consideration&mdash;that it is a good thing for a woman to be
spoiled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not certain. What do you mean by spoiled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>womanly</i> will do for a definition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Badgerly womanly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the completest sense, but womanly enough to be
spoiled&mdash;to base all her demands upon her charms, and not upon her
rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will think that over. It presents a field for interesting
thought. But do drink your medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until you have told me what you really think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you leave no place for the women with no charms. Has
she no rights either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proper sort of woman does not want any rights. She values
her charms infinitely higher than all the rights that can be given
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be exceedingly pleasant for the women who are born
charming. But I insist that a sensible woman should value the
attainable more than the unattainable. Charm is unattainable by any
conscious process. The woman born without it had better make few claims
if, to use a commercial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>metaphor, she wants her drafts
honored. There is nothing for her to do but philosophically to make the
best of the situation, and to accept those things which are the
commonly admitted rights of her sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you reason so clearly and practically. But don&rsquo;t be
a philosopher. Don&rsquo;t let philosophy creep upon you. Resist it.
You know the quotation, I am sure, &lsquo;That unloveliest of things in
women, a philosopher.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set the glass to his lips, so that he did not see how she paled
under the thrust, nor how one hand went to her throat quickly as if a
sudden pain had gripped her. When he had finished drinking and had set
the empty glass upon her tray, she switched off the light without her
usual &ldquo;good-night,&rdquo; and left him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse&mdash;Miss Ponsonby,&rdquo; said a small voice in the
gloom, a most abject voice to issue from six feet of recumbent manhood,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t you come here a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby paused, but did not look back. &ldquo;Are you
awake?&rdquo; she inquired evenly. &ldquo;I thought you were asleep
hours ago. You must be dreadfully <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42"
href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>tired. The attendant is here
now, the one who handles you so nicely. I will send him to you
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man cannot lie in the dark and cry for a nurse who will not come.
Collingwood submitted, though fear had taken possession of him. His
late audacity seemed madness.</p>
<p>The night wore on. Clouds obscured the sky, and a hot, choking
darkness blocked the windows, with solid blackness. The sounds of
traffic grew intermittent. Occasionally a carriage went past, full of
drunken soldiers or marines, shouting and singing. Once the ambulance
went out and came back with an emergency case.</p>
<p>Collingwood&rsquo;s bed commanded the door which opened into the
main ward, so that he had a perfect view of Miss Ponsonby, sitting at
her desk and working at her report. A thick green shade cut the light
from the room, but centred it like a halo around her shapely head.</p>
<p>By and by, though her features were composed, the watcher saw a
glisten of light which flashed at recurrent intervals as a tear dropped
downward. The sight filled him with repentance and perplexity. He
associated the tears, though he could not tell <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>why,
with his stolen kiss. He had kissed more young women in his life than
he had energy at that moment to remember; and no one before had felt
his caresses a reasonable pretext for weeping. Here again was that
mysterious goodness mixing up a situation which ought to have been
simple as day, and yet he was glad that it was there to mix.</p>
<p>A faint sound from Judge Barton&rsquo;s couch told him that the
Judge, too, was wakeful and had seen the sparkling drops; but he could
not hear what that gentleman was saying to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Not</i> a philosopher,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;<i>not</i> a philosopher, but uncompromising. Why isn&rsquo;t
she attractive! She ought to be attractive.&rdquo; Then, quite gently,
&ldquo;Poor creature! Why doesn&rsquo;t she surrender? Why
doesn&rsquo;t she accept the situation and compromise with
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no one to answer. Presently Miss Ponsonby, as if realising
that there might be wakeful eyes among the patients, got up and went
out into the corridor. A few minutes afterwards, the bells, the
whistles, and the revolvers of enthusiastic exiles flung out a
Christmas greeting, and her relief came.</p>
<p>Each man took unto himself a partial responsibility <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>for her
tears. Judge Barton planned to wipe out the memory of his unchivalrous
conduct by his most deferential manner and his very best conversation.
Collingwood dreamed of abasing himself, and of settling without delay
all doubts as to his attitude. If he saw a rosy vision of Miss Ponsonby
reconciled to him and forgiving, he was not altogether conceited. He
had been a man decidedly popular with women. But when the sixteen weary
hours had passed away, and the afternoon shift of nurses brought not
Miss Ponsonby but the red-haired lady of cheerful temperament, Judge
Barton&rsquo;s instinctive sigh was speedily followed by a rapt
interest in Collingwood. That young man had allowed his disappointment
to express itself by an involuntary twist in bed, so that he yelled in
agony. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=

<h2 id="xd20e531" class="main">Chapter III</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some five or six weeks after the events narrated in
the preceding chapters, Judge Barton&rsquo;s Australian chestnuts were
rattling their silver-plated harness on the Luneta driveway at sunset,
while their owner was threading the mazes of a Sunday-night carriage
jam. He had that day returned from a short vacation in Japan, where he
had gone to recuperate after his attack of fever.</p>
<p>The hot season was coming on apace, and but little breeze disturbed
the waters of the bay, which were sombred by the reflections of
slate-colored clouds streaked across the zenith. The brilliancy of the
sunset seemed to have driven apart the clouds in the west, however,
where the sky was enamelled in hues of jade and amber and turquoise,
seamed here and there with gold, and occasionally with a fading line of
dark vapor. With the purple shapes of the mountains extending to right
and left, with the foreshortened sweep of the waters, and with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>motionless lines of the anchored vessels, the
distant picture flamed out like a theatre curtain, while the motley
assemblage which filled the oval around the bandstand was not
unsuggestive of a waiting audience.</p>
<p>As he was in the act of leaning forward to note the outline of a
great five-masted freighter, anchored abreast the bandstand, Judge
Barton caught sight of a profile which was vaguely familiar to him, but
which, for a moment, he quite failed to associate with a name. A second
later, he remembered that he had always seen Miss Ponsonby in her
nurse&rsquo;s cap, and he could not determine whether it was the
harmonious effect of imported millinery or some radical change in
herself which lent a charm to her face never found there before.</p>
<p>As for the man at her side, it was something of a triumph to
perceive the hat at just the angle at which the Judge&rsquo;s
imagination had pictured it, the angle affected by a very smart
enlisted man.</p>
<p>It was not wholly in response to the political instinct which, in a
democracy, bestows handshakes in place of <i>largesse</i>, that Judge
Barton made his way to the carriage in which Miss Ponsonby sat. Since
the miserable Christmas Eve when he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>succeeded in pricking her
into a fencing match, he had not seen her. On the following day, she
was put on day duty in another ward, in accordance with some mysterious
system of change pursued in the hospital. Within three or four days
more, the Judge was pronounced able to begin the journey up the China
coast, from which he had only that day returned. When he left the
hospital, Collingwood was convalescent, but was suffering from a
moroseness which his observant neighbor attributed to thwarted
affection.</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby greeted her quondam patient not with coldness, which
may imply an intentionally concealed interest, but lifelessly, with an
indifference almost impertinent. Judge Barton felt the indifference,
was chilled by it, and revenged himself by a guarded significance of
manner which did not amount to ill breeding, but which hinted at an
expectation gratified, and made her, as he was delighted to perceive,
self-conscious and ill at ease. The feeling with which he had
approached her was genial and kindly. To find himself suddenly
enveloped in the atmosphere of challenge, of reserve, of dumb
interrogation of the providential workings of this world, stirred up in
him the old desire to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>push her just a little bit closer to the wall
against which her back was so resolutely set. It was not a chivalrous
feeling, but it was a very human and natural one, which might have been
shared by millions of the Judge&rsquo;s fellow-citizens, far more
pretentious than he was in the matter of Christian charity and
brotherhood.</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby was looking even paler and thinner than she had looked
at Christmas. There was a purpling thickness in her eyelids, there was
a depth of shadow beneath, which, to an attentive observer, hinted at
tears and vigils in the night. In her listlessness, and in a sweet
effort in her smile, the Judge found, in the further course of the
talk, the signs of conquest. It was as if, driven to bay, she sought
help even from her enemies to ease the agony of surrender. The Judge
was not hard-hearted. So long as she fought, he was willing to stab and
prick. At the first sign of feminine weakness, at the sight of her
beaten and shrinking, he was ready to forget that only a few weeks
before he had been rather eager to see her reduced to humility. His
concern for her finally found utterance in the hope that she was going
to indulge in a much needed rest. &ldquo;You know I always said, when
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>I was in the hospital, that you needed nursing
just as much as Collingwood and I did, if not more,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>She thanked him rather formally, and he detected in her stiffness an
access of shyness. A faint color dyed her cheek.</p>
<p>Collingwood, whose resemblance to a pagan deity&mdash;or to a young
ruffian&mdash;was stronger than ever, broke in joyously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s going to take a vacation, all right&mdash;a
long one, in fact, for the rest of her life&mdash;with me. You are
quite right, Judge. She does need care, and I&rsquo;ll see that she
gets it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby&rsquo;s face rivalled the afterglow into which the
gorgeous spectacle before them was beginning to melt like metals fused
in a crucible; but, after an instant, she lifted her eyes and gazed
with a remarkable intensity at Judge Barton. If her self-consciousness
had originated in a prescience of his astonishment, it was not more
painful than his own chagrin at having betrayed himself. He had
certainly not expected her to marry Martin Collingwood. He had taken a
mild pleasure in letting her perceive that he divined her struggles in
a compromise with her pride for the sake of a few passing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>attentions and pleasures; but never had it
occurred to him that she could possibly bridge the distance between
herself and Collingwood in marriage. To have exhibited his utter
amazement enraged him with himself. He recovered himself promptly,
however, and, in turn, tendered a firm white hand to each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, my children,&rdquo; he said blandly, &ldquo;I
showed some surprise, but really I don&rsquo;t know why. The thing is
obviously appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dryness in Collingwood&rsquo;s reply which made him, for
a moment, almost as impressive as the Judge himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you think so. That was my opinion from the first,
but I had considerable difficulty in getting Miss Ponsonby to take my
view of it, and even yet she has her moments of doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby gave him a shy little smile, but at the end of the
fleeting movement, her eyes again sought the Judge&rsquo;s with the
same questioning intensity, so that he was amazed to find himself
answering aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously appropriate,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and for a
hundred reasons: first, my dear young lady, so charming a person as
yourself has no business rusting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>out in the fatigues of your
profession; second, because this young free-lance needs somebody to
look after him; third, because marriage is to be encouraged on general
principles.&rdquo; At this point he seemed to recognize the necessity
of steering the conversational bark into safer waters, and endeavored
to divert it by pleasantry at his own expense. &ldquo;Although I have
not been able to induce any young woman to share my joys and sorrows,
believe me, it is not because I am opposed to the institution. If I am
an old bachelor, it is not for lack of trying to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Collingwood who made the humanely frank rejoinder, &ldquo;I
guess you haven&rsquo;t tried very hard since you have been on the
bench, have you, Judge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is strange how a man may both resent a fact and take pride in it.
Six weeks before, when the Judge had wished to put a squabbling young
woman in her place, he had rather gloried in the material advantages
connected with his position. A hint that his position might win him a
wife when his personality unaided could not do so, rasped his nerves.
Charlotte saw him wince and returned good for evil. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you are not sincere. You are too modern to believe in
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it in an ironical spirit, then, do you think, that I beg
an invitation to yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will be so very quiet&mdash;not even cards or cake;
and only one or two of Mr. Collingwood&rsquo;s friends, and one or two
of mine, to give us countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To keep us from feeling that we are eloping,&rdquo; said
Collingwood blithely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not the very man to do that? If there is no other way, I
must be railroaded in in an official capacity. Does not Collingwood
need a best man? Does not the marriage ceremony call for a parent to
give the bride away&mdash;&rsquo;Who giveth this woman to be married to
this man?&rsquo;&mdash;and all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was pure advertising propaganda, a way to one of those
newspaper squibs which delight both the snobbishness and the
sentimentality of Americans. In the slight pause which ensued, the
Judge had a momentary sensation of being weighed in a very delicately
balanced mind, and of being found wanting. But Charlotte only said,
&ldquo;You may come if you wish. But it is sooner than you
anticipate&mdash;very soon.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"
href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning at seven-thirty,&rdquo; interjected
Collingwood. &ldquo;We are going out on the Coastguard boat at
ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a burning of bridges, a lover who wooed and a maid who did
not dally! The Judge asked where the ceremony would take place, and was
told to come to a certain church not far from the hospital. Once more
his over-restraint betrayed him, and Miss Ponsonby guessed his
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were both brought up Catholics,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and though we have neither of us clung very closely to the
Mother Church, that is where we naturally turn on such an occasion. We
have not needed a dispensation. The path has been easy.&rdquo; She
smiled enigmatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t needed a dispensation from the
Pope,&rdquo; said Collingwood, &ldquo;but apparently we cannot manage
our own affairs without the help of the Civil Government. I am not sure
that we shall get through to-morrow without the appearance of some of
the gang declaring that there are reasons why this woman should
<i>not</i> be married to this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Civil Government?&rdquo; repeated Judge Barton,
mystified. Then a light broke upon him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>&ldquo;Of
course&mdash;you are under contract.&rdquo; He addressed Miss
Ponsonby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My service under contract was fulfilled five months
ago,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I am at liberty to leave Government
employ any moment I wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are long on eminent <i>medicos</i> and short on
nurses,&rdquo; went on Collingwood, whose spirits were evidently
riotous, &ldquo;and when Miss Ponsonby sent in her resignation, they
informed her of the fact, and, by the Lord! they had the effrontery to
expect us to arrange our affairs to suit their convenience. The letter
has gone back and forth till it has eighteen endorsements. It hove in
sight a few days ago in an extra large envelope. I told Charlotte to
put on a nineteenth, and to end the whole matter by telling the Civil
Commission and the Bureau of Health and the Marine Hospital Service all
three to go to the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which it was manifestly impossible for me to do,&rdquo; added
Miss Ponsonby, blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manifestly,&rdquo; assented the Judge, with a short laugh. To
him whose whole policy was diplomacy here was temerity in a twentieth
century citizen of the American Republic to mock the Civil Commission.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>As well a Venetian in the twelfth had jeered at
the Council of Ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manifestly is a good word,&rdquo; Collingwood went on.
&ldquo;It was, as you say, manifestly impossible that Miss Ponsonby
should tell the Bureau of Health to go to the devil, but it was
manifestly ordained that I should write them a letter, telling them
what I thought of them, and telling them to go to the devil&rsquo;s
place of residence; which I did. Forthwith, Miss Ponsonby was fired,
bag and baggage, from Civil employ. They had not seen their way to
releasing her for six months, but when she crossed Their
High-Mightinesses&mdash;or when I did it for her&mdash;they could let
her go in twenty-four hours. Well, what&rsquo;s one man&rsquo;s meat is
another man&rsquo;s poison. I don&rsquo;t know about their poison, but
I knew my meat when they put it in my hand, and I&rsquo;m not the man
to let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; There was a falling off in Judge Barton&rsquo;s
interest in the romance, but he struggled to conceal his feelings. He
fancied also that Miss Ponsonby was embarrassed, almost annoyed, at her
lover&rsquo;s frankness. &ldquo;To-morrow morning, you say, at
seven-thirty? I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>He turned away after his most impressive handshake, and still
pondering this inexplicable step on the lady&rsquo;s part, sought his
own carriage. Was she led by romance simply, by the belated desire for
love-making and mating which might easily seize upon a woman pushing
rapidly away from the age when romance is a right? Or had she, with a
shrewdness which belied her late folly, decided to accommodate herself
to the rather material atmosphere which prevails in Manila? Had she
perceived that Collingwood was of the stuff to win out in whatever he
undertook? And had she voluntarily embraced a temporary effacement with
him in order to return to the world better equipped for the struggle to
impress it with her personality? Whatever was her motive, she was not
wholly a happy bride, and yet,&mdash;there was something in that
fleeting smile which she had given Collingwood, something very tender,
exquisitely feminine, which touched the Judge and roused in him a
grudging spirit toward the man who had reached out his hand to take
what he, Alexander Barton, had never dreamed of taking. The Judge was
baffled, and was about to give up the problem, when the well-known
figure of his friend Mrs. Badgerly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>recalled her cleverness in
analysis and her unbounded effrontery in stating her conclusions. He
went immediately to submit his difficulty to her.</p>
<p>Collingwood and his betrothed continued listening to the evening
concert in a silence which may have expressed their entire proprietary
assumption of each other, but which, on the gentleman&rsquo;s part, was
permeated with the watchfulness of one handling an overfilled glass. He
was anxious not to joggle his companion&rsquo;s reserve, as if he
feared that the spilling of a drop or two of what was passing in her
mind might leave a few acid scars upon his complacency. There had been,
as you felt, no easy courtship. If, in the presence of others, he chose
to carry it off with a high hand, when he was left alone with her, he
betrayed that, until the final blessing should have been said over them
the next day, he was more or less in doubt of his captive. His blurting
out the news of their approaching marriage to Judge Barton had been a
stroke of policy as well as an overflow of pride. His lover&rsquo;s
watchfulness, combating with his lover&rsquo;s tenderness, told him
that every pressure must be brought to bear to keep her from halting
even at the last moment. He had realized from his earliest acquaintance
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>her that she was overworked and at the point of a
nervous and physical breakdown. He knew from her own admissions that
she had no relatives to whom she was willing to apply for assistance.
He had had her shy confession of affection for him and no few glimpses
at a depth of feeling which she would not wholly reveal. His own
rashness in meddling in her dispute with the Government officials had
cost her her means of livelihood, in the islands, at least, and his own
business was pressing him. These reasons, even unsupported by the ardor
of his love for her, seemed to justify him in applying all the pressure
he could to hurry Charlotte into marriage; but he could not be blind to
her reluctance, to a timidity and foreboding which she would not
explain but which caused her no little unhappiness.</p>
<p>Miss Ponsonby sat on in a reverie not altogether pleasant, as one or
two changes in her sensitive countenance testified. She was so
preoccupied that she remained unconscious of the playing of the
national anthem, of the dispersal of the crowd, and of the threats of a
few spattering raindrops which were not followed by a shower, but which
sent the coachman to put up the hood of their victoria. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>darkness had quite closed down upon them, the
lights on the shipping were huddled like little suburban villages on
the plain of waters, and the flash-light on Corregidor was winking an
occasional red eye low down against the sea, when Collingwood laid an
almost timorous hand upon his betrothed&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Leave that to me. It is my side of the
contract. Why do you take this ridiculous quarrel so seriously?
Besides, it was my fault. I jumped in&mdash;oh! just because I felt so
good that I wanted to tackle the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an omen. It is the recurrence of conditions that have
always weighed me down. Whatever I do, there is someone to be annoyed
and offended at the act. I am in disgrace. I have been unutterably
lonely in Manila, and I felt that in our marriage, at least, there
would be the compensation of having no one to object; and now these
offended dignitaries project themselves into the affair, trailing their
forked lightnings of displeasure. Why must combat hover over my head?
Why must I fight for what drops into the laps of other
women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t fight,&rdquo; said Collingwood. &ldquo;You
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>haven&rsquo;t fought. You have only been wearied
and discouraged and unhappy. When I came in and did a little fighting
for you, it paralyzed you. What is a row more or less&mdash;and least
of all, under the circumstances? It would take more than exchanging
compliments with the Bureau of Health to unsettle my spirits
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It crushes me,&rdquo; replied Charlotte. &ldquo;Besides, you
have not had my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collingwood studied her through the gloom. Her last words were a
lifting of the veil which, she had assured him, hid much pain. He had
been able to account for her reluctance in being hurried into an early
marriage through reasons which reflected credit upon her and were not
uncomplimentary to himself. To marry a man who had come into her life
less than three months before and who was planning to carry her off to
a practically uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean might well have
daunted the enthusiasm of a much more daring spirit than hers.
Collingwood&rsquo;s social traditions were rudimentary beside hers; but
even he, pagan that he was, could make allowances for nervousness on
that score. What he could not account for was her evident misgiving of
the ultimate outcome of their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>romance. She was vexed by doubts
which she was unwilling to share with him, and yet a few frank words in
the early days of their engagement had sufficed to remove all thought
that she was concealing from him anything that he ought to know.</p>
<p>She had told him that she had been practically an orphan since
infancy; that till she was fourteen years of age, she had been brought
up in a convent; that at fourteen she went to live in the family of her
mother&rsquo;s cousin; that she had been educated at Smith College,
taking her bachelor&rsquo;s degree there; that she had found the bread
of dependence exceedingly hard to eat, and, in defiance of her
relatives&rsquo; wishes, had taken her training as a nurse; and
finally, that she had come to the Philippines to put as great a
distance as possible between herself and them, to whom her career was a
source of humiliation. &ldquo;There has never been, in my past life,
one act of which you or I should be ashamed. There have been no events,
no episodes, nothing but a series of petty humiliations, of wasted
efforts, and of thwarted ambitions which I cannot talk about even to
you. I want to forget them. They have almost overwhelmed me. I have
been&mdash;I am&mdash;on the verge of becoming morbidly introspective
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>and retrospective. Help me to put the past away,
but not because there is one thing in it that you ought to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To such an appeal a lover can make but one reply. After that,
whenever Collingwood saw her struggling with one of her moods of gloom,
he bent his energies to its conquest, none the less willingly that he
had discovered a ready charm for its exorcising in the caresses for
which his own affection was glad to find an excuse.</p>
<p>He had early learned the futility of argument against her despondent
moods, not only because her intelligence was better trained than his
own, but because, as he admitted to himself, she had all the argument
on her side. But he possessed, in the final appeal to tenderness, a
power before which she was invariably vanquished. There was, in her shy
acceptance of his caresses, an element of childishness, of a child
yielding to some forbidden pleasure, self-rebuking, fearing a price to
be paid, yet infinitely content in the moment. She was wonderfully
self-reliant in her thinking processes, and adorably dependent in her
emotions. She could think, and she was begging of the unseen Fates to
be spared thinking. She could decide, but she was grateful to him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>for taking decision out of her hands. She loved
him, but she found unutterable difficulty in voicing her feelings. He
had found, in truth, what the coquette must skilfully feign&mdash;the
woman&rsquo;s dread of her own emotions, the alternate advance and
retreat, the struggle with her own nature, before she could submit to a
master. She was veritably a wild creature, striving to conceal the
fact, a woman of nearly thirty as timid as a girl in her teens. He was
secretly amused at the evident difficulty she experienced in
recognizing her own capacity for romance and affection; but her careful
repression of her emotions lent savor to a wooing which had in it some
of the elements of medi&aelig;valism. For the time when she would see
fit to cease her own struggle against the mysterious influences which
he felt battling against him, he could afford to wait. That such a time
would come, his natural optimism and his previous experiences with
women made him certain. In the meanwhile, he did not intend to risk a
chance word as he felt his hand so near closing on hers forever.</p>
<p>Protected by the darkness within the carriage hood, he threw an arm
about her and held her pressed to his side while he put his lips
against hers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>and finally pressed his face against her cheek in
a wordless caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to be said that we have not said,&rdquo; he
murmured at length. &ldquo;But I entreat you, in God&rsquo;s name, put
your fears aside to-night. Are we the first man and woman who have
dared risk and calamity for the sake of loving? Oh! the word sticks in
your throat, I dare say. It is wonderful how you have coquetted with
every reason which may excuse our marriage except the only one that
justifies it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if I only knew that we could be sure of ourselves,&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;But suppose it is a mistake; suppose you find me
something different from what you fancy me&mdash;I tell you every day
that you idealize me&mdash;that I cannot live up to your conception of
me! Suppose you come to hate me, as some men do hate women that are
tied for life to them, millstones around their necks!&rdquo; She
shuddered.</p>
<p>It was a line of thought so unnatural for a girl to indulge in on
the eve of her marriage, that Collingwood found time for a
moment&rsquo;s wonder what could have been the formative influences of
her life to make her look so despondently on her own powers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>of holding affection. But the moment was not for
indecision. Collingwood drew his face away from hers although he still
continued to encircle her with his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not be sure of yourself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
processes of your education seem to have left you muddled on matters
that you ought to have been clear on before now. But I&rsquo;m sure of
myself. I&rsquo;m marrying you for love&mdash;for a consuming passion,
if you like the term. I got it out of a novel. I don&rsquo;t pretend to
combat your reasons. All that you have said may be in the light of
prophecy. You may be right, but no power on earth could make me give
you up without the utmost struggle that I am capable of. I believe that
we have a happy life before us. But if I believed that it was going to
end in the blackest tribulation that man ever entered into this side of
the eternal torments, I would go on and mortgage my life for the few
weeks of joy I&rsquo;ve had and the few that may be ahead of us before
the thing goes to smash. As for you, you have resisted at every step,
and I&rsquo;ve felt every minute that you were fighting yourself more
than me.&rdquo; He crushed her against him suddenly, and as suddenly
dropped his arm from her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>waist. &ldquo;There, now, you are
free. Do you mean to tell me that you like this better&mdash;that you
are not happy in my arms? Then something in you that isn&rsquo;t your
tongue lies. Why, I&rsquo;ve felt it at every caress I&rsquo;ve ever
given you&mdash;the struggle and the yielding and the gladness. Come!
Stop coquetting with yourself! Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the minute or two which intervened before her reply, he held his
breath for fear he had gone too far. Then the soundness of his
instinctive judgment was demonstrated to his entire satisfaction. For a
second or two Miss Ponsonby strained her clasped hands to her eyes,
then she deliberately nestled back to his side, and slipped an arm
around his neck. She began to cry, the first tears her lover had seen
her shed, though he suspected that she shed many, and he hushed her to
his breast as if she were a grieving child. She cried very quietly, and
he knew that she was ashamed of her weakness. She soon regained control
of herself, and she answered his question with an instinctive sense of
fairness which he had often noticed in her. Most women would have taken
advantage of the tears to evade an acknowledgment of defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Martin,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>coquetted with myself, I have been pretending to
myself that I meant ultimately to back out, and in my heart of hearts I
knew I would not, I knew I could not. I have been selfish. I have
spoiled your happiness, and refused to accept my own for fear of the
future. Yours is the only sensible view. There are chances&mdash;but we
cannot reason, we cannot think. We must just take what life gives us;
and if by and by comes sorrow, why, we&rsquo;ve had a little taste of
joy. I am through coquetting, dear. I am happy&mdash;now&mdash;here. I
do not care what comes. I&rsquo;ve been a wretched prophet of evil,
because secretly I meant to ride rough-shod over whatever I summoned to
oppose. I surrender. I throw myself on your mercy. I don&rsquo;t
deserve quarter, but I know you will give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a very long silence in the victoria. At the end of it,
Miss Ponsonby said with a little choking laugh, &ldquo;But, Martin,
I&mdash;I distrust I&rsquo;m marrying my master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least doubt about it,&rdquo; said Collingwood.
&ldquo;But when masters are the right sort&mdash;fellows like me, for
instance&mdash;they are not a bad thing for some women to
have&mdash;women like you, for instance.&rdquo; <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What the buried archives are to the
arch&aelig;ologist, the trunkful of old letters is to the novelist. But
before those light-giving documents are brought forth, a little family
history should be detailed as preface.</p>
<p>In the year 1872 the Civil War had been more generally forgotten in
the North than in the South. In the State of Massachusetts, however, a
goodly circle of antislavery agitators still kept up the fight in favor
of the black man. The Fourteenth Amendment had not then been made, nor
those celebrated discussions which fixed its interpretation and
application; but the reconstruction of the Southern States still left
plenty of ground for bitter speech and feeling.</p>
<p>Prominent among that circle and among the old Boston families of
that day was the widow of a man who had literally given his life to the
antislavery cause, for he had died during the War of overwork upon an
antislavery journal. His widow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69"
href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>belonged to a family that for
two hundred years or more had been prominent in state and national
affairs. When her husband died and left her and a half-grown daughter
almost penniless among a wealthy kindred, she found little or no
difficulty in getting along; for their pride in the editorial victim
was great, and she had been always a family favorite.</p>
<p>But if the mother was everywhere sought, her daughter Charlotte
found a less ready welcome. A tall, superb beauty, singularly cold at
times and reserved, at others fiercely vehement, she was as utterly
unlike the descendant of a staid New England family as can be imagined.
It is regrettable that she found little favor in the family eyes; and
in the year 1872 she came to an out and out rupture with all her
kindred by eloping with Mountjoy Ponsonby, a Marylander, a Roman
Catholic, and an irreconcilable son of slave-holding parents.</p>
<p>Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash; took to her bed and died of chagrin. Four years
later the unhappy girl followed her mother to the grave, leaving behind
her a baby daughter six months old.</p>
<p>Of that marriage so soon ended, the best and the worst that can be
said is that it was unhappy. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"
href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>two undisciplined natures who
had defied tradition, family sentiment, religious training, and
political inheritance for the sake of each other, had not the patience
to work out their common happiness when the infatuation which had drawn
them together died, as all such sudden and violent emotions must.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Ponsonby turned her back on life and on an impoverished
Southern home where her New England thrift had struggled ceaselessly
with the indolence and sluggish ways of a slave-holding household, it
was after almost all possible recrimination had been exhausted over
religion, politics, family inheritance, and ideals of life. Her
husband, having buried her with due ceremony and observance in the
Maryland family vaults, betook himself to travel, leaving the child to
be cared for by a distant female relative. When little Charlotte was
four, the relative died, and, as an ultimate act of defiance to his
wife&rsquo;s kindred, Ponsonby placed his daughter in a Roman Catholic
convent.</p>
<p>There the little girl remained till her fourteenth year. In that
period, she saw her father some six or eight times. Their interviews
were constrained affairs, for Mountjoy Ponsonby was not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>a man of
domestic or affectionate nature, and the child of the wife with whom he
had quarrelled bitterly made little appeal to him. He usually gave his
daughter much good advice, found her exceedingly docile, but equally
difficult, and was always embarrassed by an unspoken appeal in her
nature which he dumbly resented. He looked forward with repugnance and
dread to the days when she could be no longer stuffed away in a
convent, and he rather hoped that she would feel herself religiously
called upon to stay there.</p>
<p>Like many other men, he had formed the habit of looking on himself
as immortal, so that when he was instantly killed by being thrown from
his horse, he had made no provision for his child&rsquo;s future. On
his own side of the family there was no near kindred; and the Boston
relatives instantly put in a claim for the custody of little
Charlotte.</p>
<p>The man who was most actively interested in the little girl&rsquo;s
future was one Cornelius Spencer, a dry, hard-working, quiet man,
capable of loving with singular intensity and equally capable of
concealing his emotions. He had paid a quiet court to the beautiful
Charlotte K&mdash;&mdash;, and family gossip said that he took her
elopement very seriously; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>but it was all conjecture, for he
kept his own counsel. A year later, he married Martha Winston, her
cousin, a lady who, furthermore said family gossip, had been in love
with him for several years.</p>
<p>The Spencer marriage turned out well; how nearly that <i>well</i>
may be translated <i>happily</i>, who can say? At least, Mr. and Mrs.
Cornelius Spencer were a decorous couple, he given to amassing this
world&rsquo;s goods, she devoted to a thrifty oversight of their
expenditures and to a calm enjoyment of their prosperity. Two daughters
came to them, handsome children whose education from the first was up
to the strictest standards of conservative Boston.</p>
<p>There was much sage wagging of heads among the Boston kin when
Cornelius Spencer came forward as the potential guardian of the orphan
immured in the convent. But though they conjectured again, Mrs. Spencer
kept her own counsel as her husband had kept his years before. Of
course, said the kinship, it was a bitter pill to her. Charlotte
K&mdash;&mdash; had always outshone her in brains, in wit, in beauty.
She had been proud to marry the man whom Charlotte had refused; and to
find that man, eighteen years later, still cherishing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>sentimental memories of her rival, determined to
make himself a second father to that rival&rsquo;s child,&mdash;ah,
well, Martha was a remarkable woman to bear it all so quietly!</p>
<p>It happened that, on the day the young girl appeared in charge of
the nun who brought her North, a very observant lady was calling upon
Mrs. Cornelius Spencer. The lady was the wife of an army officer, and
had a taste for letter-writing, in fact, felt that letter-writing was
her only gift. A few extracts from her epistle to her husband will
throw some light upon Charlotte Ponsonby&rsquo;s girlhood
experiences.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;&mdash;I have been visiting about for days
among the K&mdash;&mdash; kin. They are as magnificently satisfied with
themselves as ever, take themselves very seriously, are as proud of
their money-making powers as of their blue blood; really it&rsquo;s
wonderful how they all make money, and talk, as they have always done,
from a very much higher plane than they really live on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among others, Martha Spencer asked me to luncheon, and I went
there this morning. Really, Cornelius must have made <i>oodles</i> of
money. The mere household accessories were simple enough; but the
books, the pictures, and the curios were a joy. I feasted my soul, and
I wished for you, my dear, to enjoy it with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll talk of those things to you later. What I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>want to tell you about now is an incident that I
am afraid may slip away from me, and I want to describe it while my
impressions are fresh,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember I wrote you, in a previous letter, about the
lawsuit and how old Dry-as-dust Cornelius has a real spark of romance
in him after all, and of how he has disinterred his old love&rsquo;s
child from a convent where she was to have been buried alive. It was my
happy fate to see the sequel this morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha and I were sitting together just before lunch, when
the bell rang. &lsquo;I think that must be the little relative whom we
are expecting,&rsquo; said Martha, and a second later the butler
ushered in a nun and a fourteen-year-old girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could have seen Martha&rsquo;s greeting! It was
exactly what she would have given a woman of the world, paying a
morning call. She was concentrated extract of courtesy and breeding.
The child, who was evidently nervous and expectant of a warmer welcome
was instantly chilled by it. But she rose to it! She rose to it
magnificently! She has rather fine eyes, her mother&rsquo;s eyes as I
remember them, and a self-possessed manner for a child of her age. I
tried to gush over her a bit, but she would have none of me. Having
been rebuffed by her hostess, she had no intention of allowing an
undetermined factor to the situation to make amends to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nun would not remain, and departed immediately after
formally handing over her charge. She kissed Charlotte (the child is
named for her mother), and I rather fancied that, in spite of her cold
welcome, the child is not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>reluctant to enter on a more
brilliant life than the conventical one. At any rate, she did not shed
any tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte was sent upstairs with a maid to make her toilette
for luncheon. &lsquo;Your cousins regret not being here to welcome
you,&rsquo; said Martha suavely, &lsquo;but they went out to the
country place of a friend for a day&rsquo;s skating. They will see you
at dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am very glad they did not change their plans on my
account,&rsquo; said my little nun that might have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornelius came home for luncheon and was stiffer than Martha.
He was self-conscious, that was apparent. We had the most perfect
luncheon imaginable, but though Martha prides herself on her heating
arrangements and their temperatures never vary a degree, I felt as if
the outside air had crept through the whole house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for that girl from the bottom of my heart. Martha
hates the sight of her, and the girl knew it before she had been twenty
minutes in the house. She will have food and dress and every material
luxury dealt out to her as lavishly as it is to Martha&rsquo;s own
girls; but of good-will, kindness, human affection, not a drop.
Instead, she will receive a courtesy measured by the most approved
social standards. She will never be allowed to forget for one moment
that it is given from a high sense of duty, and not from any sense of
affection. I am not sure that Cornelius has done the child a kindness.
She might have fared better in a boarding-school. At the same time, I
have a great deal of sympathy for Martha. I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all
nice about it, you know, if you raked up a dead and gone
sweetheart&rsquo;s child and established her among our
brood.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>Within a few weeks after the writing of this epistle, Mrs. Spencer
expressed herself to an elderly relative perched in a very old colonial
home among the hills of Vermont.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Charlotte&rsquo;s little daughter is now with
us. She is a very reserved child with beautiful manners&mdash;I suppose
convent training does give that&mdash;and, her teachers think, has an
exceptional mind. We have had private teachers for her this year
because, though her elementary training is fair, she is greatly lacking
in general information, though she has a curious accumulation of Roman
Catholic religious lore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a great deal of personality for a child of her age,
which I have respected. I find myself constantly shrinking, however,
from some undercurrent of feeling which she doesn&rsquo;t express. She
gets on very well with my two girls, but they don&rsquo;t understand
her any more than I do. Of course, she is treated exactly as they
are&mdash;I really wouldn&rsquo;t get one a hair ribbon without buying
its match for Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a convent-reared girl, she is not so difficult to deal
with as might be. I send her to church every Sunday in the brougham
with the parlor maid, who happens to be of her faith; and I called on
the parish priest and commended her to his fatherly mercies. He is a
rather robust person, clearly of Irish peasant origin, and speaks with
a very decided brogue. She is plainly growing a bit fastidious about
him, and I am inclined to feel that she is none too <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>deeply
enamored of her church. She has a curious gift of worldliness for a
child brought up in a convent.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Eight years later Mrs. Spencer penned another brief note to this
same elderly relative&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I suppose it would be asking too much of you to
run down to Smith and see Charlotte take her degree. I can&rsquo;t
go&mdash;Natalie&rsquo;s engagement is just on&mdash;and somebody ought
to appear from the family. She takes high honors, I understand. She
wrote me a very pretty little note, saying it wasn&rsquo;t to be
expected of any of us to get up, but I can see she is hurt. Do go if
you can.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Six weeks later in that same year, the military lady found herself
at a very quiet and exclusive resort in the White Mountains, and once
more delivered herself to her husband of many impressions.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;You remember that incident I told you of some
years ago of seeing Charlotte K&rsquo;s daughter engulfed in the
Spencer household. Well, they are all here for a brief stay, Martha
engrossed in her two girls. Natalie&rsquo;s engagement to young
X&mdash;&mdash; of the Navy has been announced. Charlotte Ponsonby is
really a magnificent creature&mdash;from a woman&rsquo;s standpoint,
that is. But the outcome of the affair is just what might have been
expected. Somehow they have mortally wounded her, and to protect
herself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>from them and their curiosity she has built a wall
between herself and the whole world. I tried to cross it, and was most
delicately and effectively rebuffed. She is the most solitary girl I
have ever known, and yet she is not morbid. She moves among us in the
most self-possessed, <i>unasking</i> spirit that was ever held by a
girl of twenty-two. She is remarkably well bred, quite at ease
outwardly, and is altogether too clever to please men&mdash;who are
dreadfully shy of her, though they speak of her admiringly. I would not
have you think that her cleverness is of that cheap type which sharpens
its wits on others, and prides itself on its brilliancy. She is not in
the least talkative, but she gives you the feeling of one who is
weighing, sifting, analyzing, judging; who is using her brain to its
best purposes at all times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pathetic part of it all is that she is playing up to a
r&ocirc;le that somebody&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what
idiot&mdash;assigned her. I find among all the kindred and all the
family acquaintance the general opinion that Charlotte has no emotions,
nothing but a brain; and the poor child is nothing but a bundle of
emotions that she is desperately trying to conceal. I understand her
perfectly. I never was so sorry for anyone in my life&mdash;anyone in
our condition, that is. She has been tagged a girl of brains, and it
has somehow been impressed upon her that, if she shows any feminine
weakness, she will disgrace herself. So there she is, on her
intellectual tiptoes, striving to conceal a very human disposition to
come down on her heels, exiling herself from all that girlhood
prizes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you dear old goose, you are saying to yourself,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put her wise,
then?&rsquo; My dear, she has analyzed it all just as clearly as I
have. She knows what is going on. She merely hasn&rsquo;t the courage
to break through the convention and, on the whole, I don&rsquo;t wonder
at it. It takes more courage to fight the accepted conception of
oneself than it does to do any other sort of fighting in the world.
Charlotte Ponsonby is a victim of the Spencer stupidity and of her own
timidity and sensitiveness. There has grown up an impression that
Charlotte doesn&rsquo;t care for dancing; and night after night she
goes off to her room, pretending a desire to read when her heart is in
her toes, where a normal girl&rsquo;s heart should be. If there is an
expedition of any sort, Charlotte is always handed over to some elderly
fossil because she is so intelligent and serious, and so entertaining
to old gentlemen. If a man pays her the least attention, everybody
notes it (and you know we pride ourselves an our breeding too); and so
much interest, sympathy, and, yes, my dear, <i>damnable</i> curiosity,
is openly shown in the matter that the girl&rsquo;s pride is outraged,
and in sheer self-defence she snubs her admirer incontinently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lives and has always lived, as nearly as I can see,
utterly without intimate companionship, confidence, or any of that
wholesome dependence that belongs to girlhood. There is something
infinitely pathetic in her isolation, which, much as I should like to,
I dare not invade. There is a pride in life born of indigence as there
is the pride of wealth. Charlotte Ponsonby is armored in the pride born
of spiritual indigence. Her soul is hungering and thirsting for that
thing for which all the world has decided she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>cares
nothing. Mark my words, my dear, in the end, tragedy will come of
it.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was at the close of their stay in the mountains that Mrs. Spencer
again unburdened herself to the Vermont relative.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;What do you think Charlotte is now bent on? She
wants to be a trained nurse. I have felt for a long time that she had
something revolutionary in her mind. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me
particularly, but Cornelius is grieved to the heart. However, we have
no right to coerce her, and financial independence seems to be the one
thing on which her mind is fixed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Three years later she wrote again:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Charlotte has finished her training and is
going to the Philippines. She came in from New York last week to break
the news. I said little, and Cornelius said less. But we have talked it
over, and have decided that she must judge for herself. I don&rsquo;t
feel satisfied with the results of our care for Charlotte, and I
don&rsquo;t know where the blame lies, but I do feel that she cherishes
some bitterness of feeling in her heart, and that she is very
unhappy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something in her nature wears clearer as she grows older,
some ingrained romanticism which we did not suspect, and which repels
me. However, it is too late to worry about now. She has taken her life
into her own hands, and has decreed that it shall lie apart from ours;
and I, for one, am thankful.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>To these may be added a final word from Miss Ponsonby herself,
written, on her wedding eve after her return from the Luneta.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first salute">&rdquo;<span class="sc">My dear
Aunt</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the last letter I shall write you for some time, for
to-morrow I am going to be married, and shall leave Manila for a remote
island where the opportunity for correspondence is small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man I am going to marry, whose name is Martin
Collingwood, is engaged in pearl-fishing in the seas south of Manila.
He is a man, I believe, with the money-making gift. However that is not
the reason that I am marrying him. With me it is absolutely a matter of
the heart. I am marrying him because, as nearly as I can see, he is the
one human being who has ever loved me in this world, and because I
cannot live life without love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly necessary to say that I am sacrificing my
ambitions in this matter. To a woman brought up as I have been, a
dependent, a brilliant marriage would represent the most successful
thing, the most nearly compensating thing, that life could offer. It
has not come to me, however, and I am making the best I can of what has
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may wonder why this frankness at the end of the silence
which has always existed between us. It is because my only hope in the
future is based on the fact that, at last, I have courage to declare
myself. To guard my every thought and feeling from your curiosity and
criticism, I have separated myself from all the world, and in the
beginning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>unknowingly, but in the end with full knowledge,
have walked down a path which has ended here. I will not hamper myself
in my new life by even the memory of my old cowardice. You may call me
weak, call me sentimental, foolish, romantic, call me all the things
which for years you have been trying to discover in me, and for which
you have sought in vain beneath the mask I wore&mdash;I am going to
have my share of living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not written in bitterness toward you. I am grateful
for all the care and the money lavished upon me, and I realize fully
the sacrifice that you made in receiving me into your home and in
treating me, as you did, with perfect justice. It was magnificent. I am
simply one of those miserable beings who have come into this world
unwelcome, born to be a worry and a trial to someone, and I have taken
the only means I knew to escape from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Uncle Cornelius that I am not ungrateful to him. Some
day I&rsquo;ll write you again. For the present I want to put every
memory of the past out of my life. If the day ever comes when I can go
back to it without its influencing my life as it has always done,
I&rsquo;ll write again.</p>
<p class="signed">&ldquo;Yours gratefully,</p>
<p class="signed">&rdquo;<span class="sc">Charlotte
Ponsonby.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Judge Barton had to cut short his morning ride in
order to reach the San Sebastian church at seven-thirty, but he
admitted to himself that he would have gone without his daily exercise
rather than have missed the wedding; and he was actually ten minutes
early. He found the edifice empty but pervaded with a general stir
which hinted at impending events. A dirty, bare-footed sacristan in
marine blue cotton drawers and a transparent shirt was opening windows
and lighting a few candles about the high altar. The early morning
sunlight streamed through the apertures, while the noise of street
traffic outside echoed hollowly through the dusty, empty silence of the
church. Sparrows flashed across the moted sunbeams and lost themselves
among the violet and orange shadows of the lantern. A <i>pobre</i>
shuffled in to mutter his devotions, and a widow and her two daughters,
who had been praying before one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>of the chapel altars, lingered
to discover the cause of the preparations.</p>
<p>Soon one or two men dropped in, strangers to the Judge, and friends,
as he instantly decided, of Collingwood. They stood about indecisively,
and stared up into the vaulted roof, and whispered to one another in
funereally regulated tones. Then came a group of five or six women,
whom the Judge recognized as fellow-nurses of Miss Ponsonby; and almost
immediately afterwards, without ceremonial or welcome of the organ, the
bride and groom appeared. Both were in white; he in the military-cut
blouse which is so popular in the Philippines, she in a simple street
dress of white muslin with a hat of white embroidery. The marine
sacristan went to summon the priest, while the bridal pair waited
quietly in the shadow of one of the Gothic pillars.</p>
<p>When the priest, a Spaniard of ascetic and noble countenance, had
arrived and was embarked upon the marriage ceremony, Judge Barton took
himself to task for the flutter of nervousness which, to his great
discomfiture, he found obtruding into his judicial reflections. He had
come to satisfy a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85"
name="pb85">85</a>]</span>very natural curiosity, and the affair had
taken his sympathies unaware. He had never before attended a wedding in
which the seriousness of matrimonial experiment appealed to him so
strongly. He never before had felt the solemn happiness which his
sympathy with that bride and groom awoke in him. He stole a glance at
the other witnesses; they were as preternaturally grave as he. There
was even a subdued air about Collingwood, full, however, of reserved
triumph. As for the bride, her pallor and fatigue were quite evident,
but she had an uplifted look which was most attractive. He caught
himself wondering if there would be any kissing the bride, and then he
decided it was time to rein in his imagination. &ldquo;Emotions by the
quart!&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;Have I turned sentimental
old woman? Champagne wouldn&rsquo;t make me more maudlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited quite discreetly after the ceremony, till the young men
and the group of nurses had had their say, and it had been clearly
demonstrated that there would be no kissing. Then he went up and
offered Mrs. Collingwood his hand. There was a genuine friendliness in
his manner, a warmth and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>sincerity in his few words that
touched her. Her own reserve melted before them. He saw her eyes
suffuse, and a faint color glow in her cheek.</p>
<p>She was instantly aware, indeed, that she occupied a new plane in
his thoughts. She had gained upon him personally, and, as the wife of a
man engaged in developing one of the greatest resources of the islands,
and likely to become a factor of local commercial life, she would
receive consideration. She knew that he regarded her marriage as a
<i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, yet by making a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>
she had become a person to be taken into account. Stranger situations
than this happen frequently in the world&mdash;in the governmental
world&mdash;and Mrs. Collingwood did not betray her intuitions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Judge,&rdquo; said Martin jocosely, &ldquo;the Bureau
of Health did not bear down on us after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you are a Benedict, Collingwood, and &lsquo;whom the Lord
hath joined&rsquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether it is in your
service or not. My Latin is rusty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let no man, not even a Civil Commissioner, put
asunder,&rsquo;&rdquo; Collingwood finished for him. The Judge
suspected that he felt some relief in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>having the possibility of
a change of mind on his bride&rsquo;s part obviated, and the two men
smiled at each other openly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that my troubles are ended,&rdquo; said
Collingwood.</p>
<p>His wife betrayed that she was still somewhat self-conscious.
&ldquo;It remains for Judge Barton to be trite and to warn you that
they have just begun,&rdquo; she said, a little stiltedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! What does it matter whether your troubles are
beginning or ending? The point is that you have your present, your
romance. I dare say you will have your troubles&mdash;most of us do;
but to-day&mdash;&rdquo; The speaker paused expressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an extremely sensible view,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Collingwood. &ldquo;He has not your happy gift of expression, but it is
Mr. Collingwood&rsquo;s also. He told me as much yesterday. I had been
foolish enough to anticipate the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what made you look so solemn?&rdquo; the Judge
inquired playfully.</p>
<p>She blushed a little and shook her head reprovingly, &ldquo;It is no
joking matter. Try it yourself and see how you feel. Why, even Martin
looked serious.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88"
name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I was scared to death,&rdquo; Collingwood admitted.
His wife laughed softly. The Judge shook hands again with the newly
made husband in an access of geniality.</p>
<p>He declined an invitation to the hotel breakfast which was all they
could offer in the line of wedding festivity, but he found time later
to appear aboard their boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; he said as he wished Mrs. Collingwood good-by,
&ldquo;you have not seen the last of me. I am going to appear in your
island paradise sometime when you least expect me. When things get
unendurable here, I shall flee to you and solitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you think you would endure it?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<p>How long will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I must. I&rsquo;m pledged. I shall have no excuse for
repining. I took the step with my eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I fancy you do not regret leaving Manila.&rdquo; In the
wholeness of his suddenly acquired sympathy with her, the Judge quite
forgot that he had been one of the many persons contributing to the
experience which had failed to endear Manila to her. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No; my experiences here have not been altogether happy, but
perhaps I was partially to blame.&rdquo; She hesitated and looked over
at the shining roofs, at the patches of green shrubbery relieving them,
and, in the background, at the mountains where Lawton died. The launch
whistled for its passengers before Judge Barton could reply, but he
wrung her hand with the intensity of a lifelong friendship. And such is
the perversity of the human soul that his heart ached as the launch
darted up the Pasig. She had waited upon him with infinite patience and
gentleness through nearly a month of illness. He had seen her daily.
She had been so situated that the faintest effort of real kindness or
of chivalry on his part could have won her everlasting gratitude, and
probably, if he had desired it, her affection. He certainly fulfilled
the ideal which her social traditions demanded of her husband more
nearly than Collingwood did, and the Judge knew how to make himself
liked when he wanted to. But he had not tried to be kind to Miss
Ponsonby. He had been patronizing, and at times almost impertinent and
unmanly. He had not a shadow of right to the grudging sense of having
something that should have been his snatched <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>away
from him. He had even a feeling of impatience with her, a thought that
she had cheated him, that she had chosen to hide her real self from
him, and to reveal it cruelly at the moment when Fate put an
insurmountable barrier between them. He could not stifle the miserable
regrets, the sense of baffled yearning, that took possession of him. He
did his best to shake off the memory of the wedding and of her face as
he had seen it at the altar, but he could not do so. Mrs. Collingwood
became an obsession. Before the coastguard cutter had pulled its
anchor, he was wondering how soon and by what means he could invent an
excuse for visiting her at her home.</p>
<p>The coastguard steamer on the Puerta Princesa run, on which the
Collingwoods had elected to go as far as Cuyo where their own launch
would pick them up, drove a clean white furrow, and, as Collingwood had
predicted, passed Corregidor at noon. She went out through the Boca
Chica with Corregidor on the left; and Mrs. Collingwood, who was
resting in her steamer chair, smiled languidly as he glanced back at
the island. &ldquo;Corregidor over the stern,&rdquo; she murmured as if
repeating some well-worn quotation, and then went on, &ldquo;Have your
experiences <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>here led you into contact with a type of man who
has but one iterated and reiterated wish,&mdash;he is, by the way,
usually a major in the United States army,&mdash;which wish is
&lsquo;to see Corregidor over the stern&rsquo;? I do not know how many
times my tongue has burned to suggest that the wisher take a coasting
steamer and see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the army&rsquo;s sore on the Philippines,&rdquo; remarked
Collingwood.</p>
<p>She eyed him reflectively. &ldquo;And you, who have been in it, seem
to be &lsquo;sore&rsquo; on the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he exclaimed heartily, &ldquo;Any
man who has once served his country as a high private and has gotten
out is &lsquo;agin the Government&rsquo; for the rest of his life. I
came over on the troop deck of a transport, and I swore I&rsquo;d go
home on a liner or leave my bones here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which seems likelier to be attained?&rdquo; she asked,
smiling idly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which do you think yourself? You&rsquo;ve linked your
fortunes with mine. Why?&rdquo; he added fixing her with a sudden
intensity of glance insistent for reply.</p>
<p>His wife crimsoned and looked across the glinting sea. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you answered that question to your satisfaction
last night,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I tried to answer it for you. It was you that needed
convincing. Here is a case of temperament,&rdquo; he went on, half
jocose, half serious. &ldquo;So long as you hesitated and I had my side
to urge, any old reason would do for me. I would clutch at a straw and
hold on to it as if it were a cable. But now everything is settled and
final, I want to understand. I want you to make yourself clear to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Martin! The idea is out of the question. Why,
for a month you have professed to be able to make me clear to
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin ruffled his hair with a puzzled hand. &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;Did it strike you as cheeky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I was heartily grateful. You helped me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the way of common sense,&rdquo; Charlotte said, as simply
as if the remark were an everyday one, and her husband&rsquo;s somewhat
startled acceptance of the reply sent her into a ripple of laughter, in
which, after an instant, he joined heartily.</p>
<p>Their merriment attracted the attention of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>only
other passengers, two enlisted men going out to join a hospital corps
at Puerta Princesa. It also drew upon them a frown of disfavor from the
captain.</p>
<p>The captain was an old-time skipper from a tramp freighter, with the
freighter&rsquo;s contempt for passengers. He was not married, and he
had little sympathy with the billings and cooings of newly married
couples. As often as his eyes fell on the orchids and ferns and potted
plants which were hanging from stanchions and cumbering his decks (Mrs.
Collingwood was taking them down for the adornment of her new home) he
cursed picturesquely. To his second officer he had expressed a desire
for a typhoon that would roll the deadlights out of his boat, and blow
the hyphenated &ldquo;garden truck&rdquo; into the Sulu Sea. He had
emphasized his distaste for bridal society by setting a table for
himself and his officers on the forward deck behind the steering
apparatus, thus leaving the tiny dining-room entirely to the despised
passengers.</p>
<p>Yet there had been little enough sentimentality exhibited to arouse
his displeasure. Mrs. Collingwood spent her day in the steamer chair
while her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>husband walked the deck with his cigar or sat
chatting at her side. The hospital men, covertly watching them as
everybody does a bridal pair, opined that they were a &ldquo;queer
proposition&rdquo; but quite agreed that they seemed happy.</p>
<p>To Collingwood, the change in Charlotte&rsquo;s mood was an intense
relief. The hesitations and self-questionings with which she had
puzzled him for a month previous had apparently been quieted by the
finality of the marriage ceremony. That she was nervously worn out by
the strain of the previous weeks and by the disagreeable circumstances
of her quarrel with the Government he realized; and with a delicacy for
which she was thoroughly grateful, he refrained from the rather ardent
demonstrations of his courtship, and treated her with matter-of-fact
kindness and good fellowship. She was his, and she seemed contented and
at peace. It was a glorious summer day, the sea was waveless, the boat
was clean and quiet, and might almost have been their private yacht, so
completely were they alone. A chance observer beholding a lazy young
woman in a deck chair and a quiet young fellow pacing to and fro near
her might have taken them for a young married couple of some
weeks&rsquo; or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>months&rsquo; standing. He would hardly have
suspected a bridal couple.</p>
<p>Yet the young man&rsquo;s mind, as they steamed past the beautiful
wooded heights of Mindoro, and looked up and up at the giant forests or
out over the gleaming water, was a tumult of joy and triumph and
wonder&mdash;the wonder being by no means in the smallest proportion.
His wife was not a beautiful woman, but his lover&rsquo;s eyes endowed
her with every beauty as she lay scanning the tree-clad mountains. That
fine quality of breeding in her which Collingwood was unable to define,
but which pleased him inordinately, was never more apparent. Moreover,
he had found her in times past a rather difficult person to deal with,
and behold! in the Scriptural &ldquo;twinkling of an eye,&rdquo; her
thorniness had vanished and a docility as agreeable as it was
unexpected had given him fresh cause for self-gratulation.</p>
<p>Still, as he had confessed, his temperament inclined him to
retroactive investigation. So long as she proved obdurate and was not
yet won, Collingwood could not analyze. But with the struggle past he
had time to take up the contradictions of her attitude, and he found
little to justify his bold statement <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>that he could read her
better than she could read herself. If, as he had somewhat daringly
reminded her, she was happy in his arms, it was a happiness, as he
could not but realize, of less ecstatic measure than that of many of
the predecessors who, with or without the sanction of an engagement,
had yielded to their pressure. She was a novice at love-making, as a
man less experienced than her husband would easily have guessed; and
she was reticent, not only in the voluntary expression of that fact,
but in response to his tentative overtures to her to confess it.
Collingwood was no less puzzled by the fact than by the philosophy of
life which desired its concealment. He had known many young women in
his life who were not novices at love-making, but who ardently desired
to be thought so.</p>
<p>An ironical sense of his wife&rsquo;s power to baffle him tempered
more than one of the affectionate glances he cast upon her as he
strolled back and forth beside her chair. The consciousness of her
mental superiority, of her obedience to perceptions and convictions
which were only half formulated in his own mind, was literally seeping
through Collingwood&rsquo;s brain. He was inordinately proud of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>her. Her excellence was a proof of his own good
taste. He felt that she was a credit to him. He did not associate her
intelligence and her grace with a class distinction. On the contrary,
it was one of his sources of joy that he would take her out of the
masses and make her of the classes, only Martin did not use those
terms. In his simple philosophy, people with money were important, and
people without it were not. Miss Ponsonby had been poor. She had earned
her own living. Ergo, she was nobody. But he, Martin Collingwood, would
make her somebody, and when he had done so, she would fill the position
to his entire satisfaction. He did not ask himself if he would come up
to her expectations. He did not understand that a woman can ask for
more in a husband than for a lover, a master, and a provider of the
world&rsquo;s goods. In spite of his public-school education, Martin
Collingwood&rsquo;s philosophy of life was a very primitive one, based
upon a sense of sex superiority. He could realize that a woman can be a
man&rsquo;s inferior; but he supposed that the mere fact of his sex
makes any man the equal of the proudest woman who lives.</p>
<p>So Collingwood continued to walk the deck in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>fool&rsquo;s paradise, and his wife lounged away
her day, if not in his blissful state of ignorance, a happy and
contented woman, nevertheless. There was a soundness in that primitive
philosophy of her husband&rsquo;s which she was proving. If Collingwood
did not have all the requisites of a woman&rsquo;s ideal of her
husband, he had at least three-fourths of them; and Mrs. Collingwood
was enough of a philosopher (little as she liked being told so) not to
cavil at the missing quarter when they were hurrying away from the
conditions that made that quarter vital.</p>
<p>The coastguard steamer skirted the coast of Mindoro and then turned
her nose westward. The next day, she crept up under the pinnacled
heights of Pe&ntilde;on de Coron in a jade-green sea, and entered the
channel between Coron and Bushuanga. There the water was like purple
glass, save where a rush of porpoises parted it in swift pursuit of the
flying-fish. Fairy islets dotted its dazzling surface while the land
masses on either hand were clothed in amethystine haze.</p>
<p>The boat lay half a day off the curving beach of Culion, and the
travellers stared up at the nipa houses of the leper colony, clinging
to the hillsides, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99"
name="pb99">99</a>]</span>and at the gray old church and the fort on
the left, speaking of the day when Moro <i>paraos</i> were no strangers
to the peaceful locality. On the third night, it anchored in Halsey
Harbor, &ldquo;which is,&rdquo; said Collingwood, &ldquo;the last place
on earth except the one we are going to live in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this somewhat discouraging remark, Mrs. Collingwood, who was
leaning over the rail, staring into darkness and the massed bulk of
land near, made no reply. Immediately after the dropping of the anchor,
the captain, accompanied by his third officer and the two hospital
corps men, had gone ashore to call upon the single American family
which was holding Halsey Harbor. He did not invite the Collingwoods to
go, glad apparently to be out of their sight for a time. They laughed
at their power to arouse his distaste, and agreed that they were the
gainers by his dislike. The fiery cigar tip of the officer on watch was
the only reminder that the boat was not wholly in their hands.</p>
<p>Collingwood, throwing away his cigar, slipped an arm around his
wife, who never objected to petting. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; she said dreamily; &ldquo;I
never knew before that tree toads made silence. I thought they made
noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was one of those cloudy ones which occur so frequently in
the tropics, when the vapors hang low at dusk, to dissipate later. The
boat seemed to be at anchor in a bay shut in by low hills, for, at one
point, a rift in the clouds showed the pallor of the sky and a single
star, below which the solid blackness loomed in relief, and against
which a clump of bamboo teased the eye with its phantom outline. A
faint chorus of insects and tree toads and the insistent cry of an
<i>iku</i> lizard suggested that the boat must be fairly close to the
shore, but, as Mrs. Collingwood had said, the sounds only emphasized
the stillness. Low down in the gloom&mdash;so low as to suggest a
valley between the hills&mdash;a light burned steadily with a sweet and
human significance in the tremendous vagueness about them.</p>
<p>There was almost trepidation in Collingwood&rsquo;s inquiry if she
found it lonesome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. Or rather, I find it tremendously lonely,
and enjoy it. Are you worrying about me when it is too late? Do not do
so. I shall find plenty to occupy me on the island.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;For a woman who held back as persistently as you did, you
have experienced a wonderful change of heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think I was afraid of loneliness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! I didn&rsquo;t know what you were afraid of, but I
could see you were afraid of something. I had to take it into
consideration. It was one of a lot of things working against me which I
had to combat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a long, long pause. Eight bells sounded. The second
engineer came out on the lower deck and cursed some of the Filipino
crew who had stretched themselves for a night&rsquo;s rest in such a
manner as to block the passage-way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; insisted Collingwood, &ldquo;am I a good guesser
or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the island? No, dear. My imagination took hold of that
at once. The thought of living on a practically uninhabited island
stirred up all the romance there is in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, then? Come, we&rsquo;re married. Out with
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me yourself in so many words that I was coquetting
with myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said anything like that,&rdquo; declared Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>Collingwood with a vivacity inspired by a
premonition of the resentment she might feel. But Charlotte only
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were your exact words,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;They
were quite true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not all,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;It was more
serious than that. I felt something mighty heavy in the atmosphere at
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Collingwood reflected a few minutes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think,&rdquo; she said then, &ldquo;that any woman of mature
age&mdash;of my age&mdash;would hesitate to marry a man of whose family
and antecedents she knew as little as I did of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: I don&rsquo;t see what my family had to do with it. In
the first place I haven&rsquo;t any near relatives living now, as I
told you; and if I had, you wouldn&rsquo;t have married them. You have
married me. As for my antecedents (I suppose you mean my conduct), I
told you myself that I had been no saint. I&rsquo;m just a good average
citizen. I&rsquo;ve known better men than I am, and I have known worse.
I have not been married before; that&rsquo;s the main thing, after all;
and no woman ever had cause for a breach-of-promise suit against me. I
had &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (he named a man locally prominent)
&ldquo;write <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>to you and tell you that he came from the same
town with me, and he knew my record was what I had told you. Besides, I
didn&rsquo;t give a thought to your family, and you have talked less
about them than I have talked of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. Do you think me secretive? There is nothing to
be secretive about. But my life with my relatives was too painful to
talk about, even to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that. I guessed it must have been hard to anybody so
loving and tender as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin, when did you form the impression that I am loving and
tender?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so; but most people have not thought so, you know.
What made you decide differently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that first night in the hospital after they had fixed me
up in the operating room, and the chloroform wore off, and my fever
came up. God! I can feel it all now! And just when I thought that I
could not stand things any longer, and must yell, you came along with
an ice bag and gave me a piece to suck.&rdquo; His wife smiled in the
darkness at his homely phraseology. &ldquo;It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>seemed to me I had never heard a woman&rsquo;s
voice in my life as soft as yours was when you said, &lsquo;You are in
great pain, I know.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was what I should have done for anybody,
Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it. That&rsquo;s why I felt that you were gentle and
loving. I would have liked to put my arms around you and cry. I wanted
to be babied. It is strange, isn&rsquo;t it, how physical suffering can
unman a fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte turned her eyes on him for an instant. He could just see
their gleam by the reflection of a ray streaming out on the water from
a light on the lower deck, and they were infinitely tender yet
mirthful. &ldquo;You understand yourself thoroughly,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You were a brave baby and a good baby but you were a baby,
Martin, a great six-foot baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it made you fall in love with me&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but I didn&rsquo;t then. You bullied me into being in
love with you. You wouldn&rsquo;t give me a chance to make myself
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that time I kissed you?&rdquo; said Martin,
referring to that episode for the first time since his very formal and
abject letter of apology had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>met an equally formal but cold
forgiveness from her.</p>
<p>To his consternation, she drew away from him in sudden displeasure.
&ldquo;Perhaps we had better not speak of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we speak of it? Is it a crime for a man
to kiss a woman he loves? Did it contaminate you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had given you no right, no encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have done it if I had known I was to be kicked out
of the hospital, broken ribs and all. Besides, how is a man to know
whether he has any rights till he exercises them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin put the question seriously in all good faith. It was his
primitive philosophy again, the simple way in which he tested women in
his sphere of life. She was at a loss how to reply, and somewhat sore
put to hide her inexperience in affairs of the sort. She had been
brought up to believe that milkmaids kiss their young men over the
gate, but that, in refined society, men offer no caresses to girls whom
they respect, unless a troth has first been plighted. Had she chummed
more with girls and young women, she might have learned that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>even in the best of society, young people pay
little heed to the strong statements of their elders, and that, wise
heads to the contrary, young blood will have its toll. But Charlotte
had had no chums and had never exchanged gossip over late bedroom
fires. Her views on the propriety of kissing were entirely theoretical.
But that kiss was a sore remembrance with her. It marked the beginning
of the end. It was an opening door which gave her an instant&rsquo;s
glance into the kingdom of love; and from its bestowal, she had known
that she was confronted with a mighty temptation to open it further and
to go boldly into the fair land. How hard she had fought with the
inclination, she could never tell Martin Collingwood; but she had
fought, and she had lost.</p>
<p>She glanced up at him penitently after his last speech, and marked
the cessation of her involuntary resentment by slipping back into his
arm. He was emboldened to make a query which had been on his tongue a
dozen times, but which, up to that hour, not even the proprietary sense
of the husband had enabled him to regard as discreet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte, am I really the first man you ever cared
about?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely the first to whom I ever gave a sentimental
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The delighted recipient of this compliment did not, in the joy of
hearing it, examine it too closely. When he did begin to speak, his
wife was pleased to note that he was less inclined to investigate the
cause of the phenomenon than to speculate upon its uncommonness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you were about,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty good luck for me, but&mdash;not in an
uncomplimentary sense&mdash;you must have been an awful
goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly. I was an awful goose; and, being so,
I had an inspiration to keep out of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was afraid of being in love. Can you understand
that? Because love was altogether associated in my mind with
pain&mdash;the pain of losing, and the pain of loving and of not being
loved, and of being generally misunderstood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all that because you were raised an orphan. I don&rsquo;t
think you had a fair show, old girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I had not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood decisively.
She added, &ldquo;But I had rather not talk about it. It makes me
morbid.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Were your folks well to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were people of considerable wealth. I do not think they
ever grudged me anything I cost them. But I was in a false position in
their house, and I was conscious of it. The knowledge put me at a
disadvantage with all the world. It made me feel myself different from
everybody else. I was self-conscious, afraid of being an object of
pity. It was like failing to possess some essential article of dress
that everybody else has, and trying to cover up one&rsquo;s
nakedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I couldn&rsquo;t put it into words, but that
is exactly how you acted with Barton. You seemed to shrink away from
him and to be ready to fight him if he spoke pleasantly to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! was it so bad as that?&rdquo; Charlotte&rsquo;s
heart sank. Her way of expressing facts differed considerably from his,
and the balance of vividness and realism was in his favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, just like that. But you were not that way to me. Why
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her woman&rsquo;s wit, already quickened by her increased experience
with men, showed her how to be truthful, and, in so being, how to
deceive him most. &ldquo;Ah! you were different,&rdquo; she murmured.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>But after he had led her, in response to her
request, back to her chair, and was pacing to and fro beside her in
quiet happiness, her heart reproached her. She had not shrunk from him
because she knew that he was blind, because, to carry out her simile,
he could perceive nothing lacking in her raiment. But those keen eyes
of Judge Barton&rsquo;s had questioned her, had perceived every rag and
tatter!</p>
<p>The captain returned and called Martin to deliver to him a message
from the Inhabitant of Halsey Harbor. Charlotte was left alone to her
musings.</p>
<p>She was very happy. The old saying, &ldquo;Out of sight, out of
mind&rdquo; was proving its appositeness in her case. No one was about
her who could read her, who could perceive the absence of any necessary
raiment, who would be conscious that there was anything odd in her
being Martin Collingwood&rsquo;s wife. She had, in one decisive action,
destroyed all that was holding her spirit in leash. A woman yet young,
whose emotions had been stifled for a lifetime, in whom the warmth of
love had been overlaid by the calculating egoism of a nature wounded to
the quick, she had emancipated herself at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>fortuitous moment, alive to the rapture of
passion, of freedom from all the restraints that had curbed her
existence. She had thrown the admonitions and the self-restraint of a
life-time aside for a romance. She had (but fortunately for a time she
was able to put the fact out of mind) quite justified a conventional
assumption that a woman&rsquo;s nature is full of primitive evil, and
that you must pitch your maxims pretty strong if you would have them
believed at all, and that then, ten to one, she will demolish all your
precautions at a bound if an object in trousers holds out his arms. She
had profited by her husband&rsquo;s view. &ldquo;Come what may,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I will have my romance and pay the price
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far, the price seemed a remote contingency. With every revolution
of the steamer&rsquo;s screw, Manila and her distant relatives whose
pride she had outraged became the mere phantoms of memory, growing
paler every hour. Nothing was left but the delightful sense of being an
absolute necessity to Martin&mdash;she who had been a superfluity all
her life!</p>
<p>As for Collingwood himself, his kindness, his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>shrewdness, his strength were gaining constantly
in her esteem. He had proved himself innately delicate and refined. Of
what possible importance were a few <span class="corr" id="xd20e1145"
title="Source: deficiences">deficiencies</span> in speech, a too vivid
phraseology, the lack of the little courtesies which mark a man of the
world? But (and here some of her elation diminished) if they mattered
so little, why had she to convince herself so eagerly? If two negatives
make an affirmative, too passionate a denial sometimes constitutes an
assertion. Whenever she arrived at this stage of reflection, another
cloud dimmed her horizon. Was not her whole attitude a practical
deception of the man himself? Would Martin Collingwood have accepted
her surrender so joyfully, could he have read that it was weighted with
the condition of living with him on an uninhabited island? Would not
all his self-esteem repudiate such a proposition? She had not lied when
she said that she loved him, but would he content himself with a
definition of love which excluded all natural pride of choice, and put
a compromise value upon himself? As often as she found herself
confronted with these thoughts, Charlotte took refuge in a bit of
casuistry. If she saw Martin with clear eyes and underrated the
proportional <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>value of his attainments, did he even see her
clearly at all? Did she wrong him more in reserving an opinion of his
social worth than he wronged her in not perceiving that she had any
social worth? The fact that every person has a real personal value and
an accredited worldly value, and that most effort is directed to making
these two values coincide, or appear to do so, put a convenient weapon
in her hand. Since, in only a few cases, the two values are really
identical, happy marriages must be the result of a marvellous luck or
of a wonderful power of self-deception. Was she to be taxed for not
deceiving herself? Was her intelligence to be punished when his
ignorance was rewarded? As often as she thought about it, it seemed
that his incapacity to value certain qualities of her own justified her
in a few mental reservations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she was afflicted with a sense of penitence in spite of
her sophistry, and when, after a long conversation with the captain,
her husband came back to her and bent over her, she put up her arms and
drew his face down to hers, giving him the first voluntary caress which
she had bestowed upon him since the hour of her surrender upon the
Luneta. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought me a selfish, ungrateful wretch?&rdquo; she
asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! But I have worried a little. There&rsquo;s no getting
around it&mdash;you are daffy about some things, Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daffy is such a beautiful word. It&rsquo;s so civil.
I&rsquo;ll adopt it. You are not daffy about anything but me, are you,
Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kingsnorth says I&rsquo;m daffy about anything that I really
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about Mr. Kingsnorth&mdash;all about him. Analyze him
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that sort of thing. Besides, I want you to
form your own impressions. You will see him in thirty-six
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon as that.&rdquo; She drew a long breath, and fell
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain says he is going out at dawn. We ought to make
Cuyo by five to-morrow afternoon, and if Mac&rsquo;s there with the
launch, as he surely will be, we&rsquo;ll get our freight transhipped
and make the run over to-morrow night. That will bring us home by dawn
the day after to-morrow. Home,&rdquo; he repeated softly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dreamed many dreams <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>in my life and some
of them have come true, but I don&rsquo;t think anything stranger could
have happened to me than taking my wife home to an uninhabited island
in the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing stranger could have happened to you than finding
yourself married at all. Isn&rsquo;t that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; he admitted slowly. &ldquo;I was
not planning to marry for many a year. I don&rsquo;t know that I
thought seriously about doing it at all. In fact, I was so afraid that
I might be injudicious and get married&mdash;or get myself
married&mdash;&rdquo; he smiled in the darkness&mdash;&ldquo;that I
swore off even on flirtations some time before I came out here. But
when you came along with the ice-bag and your nice voice, and I got a
good look at you next day, all that went up in the air. I knew then and
there that I wanted to get married as quick as I could. I&rsquo;d been
in love before a half dozen times, but I knew every time that it
wasn&rsquo;t a love I wanted to marry on. It don&rsquo;t matter how
much a man loves a woman, he don&rsquo;t love her in the right way
unless she does him credit. I felt that way about you. You were the
kind of woman I could be proud of all my life. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the
girl for me,&rsquo; I said, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>sure enough&mdash;&rdquo; his
pause expressed the idea that the outcome had been foreordained.</p>
<p>His desire to compliment her was so unmistakable, his admiration was
so sincere, that Charlotte was able to stifle quickly the first
instinct to rebuke his unconscious patronage. His egoism, after all,
was of an inoffensive variety. He was not boasting himself as a
connoisseur, but was testifying to the completeness with which she
satisfied his ideal. The wife lay silent for a long time, studying his
face, which was just dimly visible in the glow of his cigar. When she
spoke, it was as she rose from her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll always be able to live up to your
conception of me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I mean to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied the man of common sense. &ldquo;You
just suit me perfectly as you are. Why, you&rsquo;d spoil it all if you
even thought of trying. What is there to try? You are <i>you</i>. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have the biggest fault or the smallest virtue in you
altered by the ten-millionth of an inch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Charlotte had shut the door of her stateroom and had snapped on
the light, she sank for an instant on the locker, with a face in which
pride, shame, and contrition were tumultuously mingled. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>For
why had she spent twenty-eight years acquiring tastes and criterions
which, at that moment, made her seem incredibly mean and ungenerous?

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was well on in the afternoon of the next day when
they anchored off Cuyo, which, with its squat lighthouse and low shore,
impressed Charlotte as a dreary, lonesome spot. A launch, which was
lying abreast the lighthouse, saluted them with vociferous toots, and
Collingwood waved his hat in joyous response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mac, all right,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be aboard directly. It&rsquo;s a wonder he
didn&rsquo;t hire the town band to welcome us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte winced and secretly rejoiced that for once Mr.
Maclaughlin&rsquo;s initiative had failed to come up to its reputation.
Yet when a boat came alongside, and a grizzled Scotch-American stepped
up the short ladder, her greeting was warm enough to fully satisfy her
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul!&rdquo; said Mr. Maclaughlin, giving her a lengthy
handshake and a look of unqualified admiration, &ldquo;but you could
ha&rsquo; knocked us down with a feather the day the letter came saying
that Martin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>would bring back a wife. Kingsnorth nigh took to
his bed on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consternation was plainly written on Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s face.
Her sensitiveness was a-flutter, fearing a cold welcome from her
husband&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she began, and then came to an
awkward stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence, I hope,&rdquo; said Maclaughlin, reading the
signs, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s well over it by now. Kingsnorth is just one of
those poor bodies we call a woman-hater; and you&rsquo;ll notice, Mrs.
Collingwood, that they always begin life just the opposite. He thought
he&rsquo;d found a bunkie for life in Martin, an&rsquo; the lad fooled
him! I don&rsquo;t say but we were all surprised, but you&rsquo;ll find
a hearty welcome at the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get out to-night?&rdquo; asked Collingwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out in an hour if we can get our freight transhipped,
unless Mrs. Collingwood is in a mind to stay and see the city by
gaslight.&rdquo; He jerked a derisive thumb in the direction of the
iron and nipa roofs ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the light stuff is on deck now,&rdquo; said Martin whose
instincts to accomplish whatever was to be done mastered any tendency
toward conversation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"
name="pb119">119</a>]</span>He pointed, as he spoke, to a
tarpaulin-covered heap forward. &ldquo;The heavy cases are stored where
they can be hauled up in a minute. I&rsquo;ll see the captain at once.
He won&rsquo;t try to delay us, not he. Get alongside right away, with
the launch, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt you&rsquo;ve gone broke,&rdquo; remarked Maclaughlin,
contemplating the heap and smiling at Charlotte, who laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so had as that, I hope,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;but
some of the credit is due me that he hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; her husband supplemented.
&ldquo;I wanted to buy out Manila and wire additional supplies from
Hong Kong. However, we can talk about that later. Thank the Lord, there
isn&rsquo;t any sea on. We would have the devil&rsquo;s own time
transhipping, if there were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dashed off, and Maclaughlin jumped into his boat with an order to
the native rowers to hurry. For an instant, Charlotte was annoyed by
their unceremonious departure, but her good sense soon rose superior to
her training. Martin alert, talking business, with his hat on the back
of his head, a long pencil emphasizing his gestures, was a very
different figure from the insouciant young pagan, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>alternately jocose and pleading, that had wooed
her. How quickly, too, the easy speech of the husband had possessed
him. &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s own time&rdquo; came ripping out with
unconscious force. At first, Charlotte&rsquo;s fastidiousness revolted
from it. Then she decided that it was virile and that she liked it.
Still, she mused, if he felt the need of emphatic embellishment to
point the assertion of so simple a fact as that, what might he not do
when an occasion out of the ordinary arose?</p>
<p>Her question was answered before their goods and commissaries were
aboard the launch, and, for a time, she could not tell whether she
wanted to laugh or to cry. While she was still in doubt, her husband
came back, red and perspiring, with his coat off. He held out a collar
and necktie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look out for these things for me, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My! I&rsquo;m pretty well cussed out. Hope
I didn&rsquo;t shock you, pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, but it didn&rsquo;t matter; or rather, it passed the
point of shocking. You have the towering imagination in profanity,
Martin, of an architect of sky-scraping buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collingwood was able to extract a compliment from this, and looked
grateful, though he was evidently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>impressed by the form of its
expression. &ldquo;I may have said a little too much,&rdquo; he
apologized, &ldquo;but a man would have to be a saint not to lose his
temper&mdash;Here!&rdquo; he roared, as three of the crew, having
mounted to the upper deck and having armed themselves with a flower pot
apiece, started brazenly off with their burdens, &ldquo;take two of
those at a time. How many trips do you plan to make with this flower
garden, anyway? You see that everything is right in the stateroom,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he threw over his shoulder as he darted
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied, adding to herself, &ldquo;for
I shouldn&rsquo;t like you to &lsquo;cuss&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt quite safe from any such dire possibility, or she could not
have joked about it even with herself. Nevertheless, she was very
thoughtful as she gathered up their belongings and put them in the
valises, leaving, however, the strapping and the pulling to be done by
Martin.</p>
<p>When she had done all that there was to be done, and had put on her
hat, she sank down on a locker, still holding her husband&rsquo;s
discarded collar, and let her thoughts dwell rosily on the part she
could play in the island life. A guilty conscience urged her to acts of
reparation. All that she could do to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>bring order and
system and beauty into her husband&rsquo;s home she was resolved to do.
He had told her enough to let her know that he had lived in an unlovely
fashion, and that he had aspirations for something better, though he
could not define what he objected to in the past, or just what he
wanted in the future. He was bent on making money, chiefly because he
seemed to feel that there was no way of obtaining his ideal without
large expenditures; and yet he was not ostentatious. He had been very
liberal&mdash;extravagant, she had laughingly told him&mdash;in the
purchase of household belongings; and she had told the truth when she
said that she deserved the credit of restraining him. He was going to
become the typical American husband, who labors unceasingly that his
womankind may be decked in finery and may represent him in the whirl of
society; but his wife could see that, until such a time as their
prosperity should be at flood tide, he would expect her to administer
wisely and economically. He gave much&mdash;as far as he was conscious
of her needs&mdash;and he would ask proportionally in return.
Charlotte&rsquo;s head reared proudly to meet the thought. She would
not fail him. And then she vowed for the hundredth time, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>that
his unstinted devotion should meet with its just due, and that never,
never should Martin suspect how she had had to battle with herself
before she could conquer the feeling that her love was a shame to
her.</p>
<p>Martin, coming to seek her in order to introduce her to the wife of
a local military officer, found her sunk in reverie with his crumpled
neck-wear pressed against her cheek. He put on a clean tie and collar
and they went on deck together.</p>
<p>The military officer&rsquo;s wife was a young woman, plainly of
village origin, who was carrying the wide-spreading sail which many
Americans in the Philippines elect to display in the exuberance of
having journeyed to foreign lands. Her appearance jarred on Mrs.
Collingwood, and her conversation, which was frivolous and full of
assumption, reinforced the unfavorable impression.</p>
<p>The lady had met Collingwood three or four times before, and had
treated him with scant courtesy, because he had been an enlisted man.
But when she heard that he was married, and that his wife was aboard
ship, her curiosity got the better of her exclusiveness&mdash;that and
her eagerness to hear the sound of her own voice, for there were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>few Americans in Cuyo, and she was already on
bad terms with several families. She threw a gushing condescension into
her manner of greeting Charlotte, which put that young woman&rsquo;s
nerves on edge at once. But Mrs. Snodgrass (&ldquo;What a name!&rdquo;
thought Charlotte, &ldquo;I never expected to meet it out of
books!&rdquo;) was determined to make the best of the conversational
opportunity. After a somewhat ingenuous scrutiny, she invited the
Collingwoods to dinner. Charlotte was about to decline, when Martin
interrupted and said that their being delayed an hour or so was of no
importance; that it was evidently going to be a clear night, and they
had time enough to make the run over before dawn. Charlotte supposed
that some affection for Lieutenant Snodgrass&mdash;who had been a
captain of volunteers in the war, and Martin&rsquo;s officer&mdash;was
the cause of her husband&rsquo;s eagerness, and she accepted the
invitation at once. She went ashore with the Lieutenant&rsquo;s wife,
while Martin remained to see to a few last details, and to make some
arrangements with Maclaughlin.</p>
<p>Lieutenant and Mrs. Snodgrass (he had not been able to secure
entrance to the regular army with his volunteer rank) were comfortably
domiciled, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>and the meal was a good one, though Charlotte
was made uncomfortable by the hostess&rsquo;s repeated apologies both
for her food and her service. &ldquo;The servants are such impossible
creatures here, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; fluttered the little
woman who, before her marriage, had been a stenographer working for
twelve dollars a week, and who had never enjoyed the luxury of a
servant in her life till she came to the Philippines.</p>
<p>Charlotte glanced at her in surprise. &ldquo;I had not thought
so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They need a great deal of training, of
course, but I fancied them ideal servants, so truly of the servant
class, believing that God ordained us to be masters, and them to serve.
At home, I feel that servants do not acquiesce in the situation, and
the more intelligent they are, the more sensitive I am to the
undercurrent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that Mrs. Snodgrass regarded this remark as verbiage.
&ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never felt that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; remarked Lieutenant Snodgrass, who was
a self-made man, but who was taking on his army training with great
quickness, &ldquo;Mrs. Collingwood prefers an aristocratic social
system to a democratic one.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126"
href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Charlotte assented, &ldquo;though
theoretically I stand for democracy like all good Americans. You
inferred a condition of my mind of which I was hardly conscious myself.
But I suppose you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, Collingwood? You are the most rabid
democrat I know. Are you going to bring your wife over to your way of
thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin was staring at Charlotte, who began to color with
embarrassment. Her view-point had seemed to her so natural and so
simple that she was quite unprepared for the comment it evoked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to coach you up before I turn you loose on
people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, I never thought it of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Snodgrass assumed the air of a man, the length of whose
matrimonial experience justifies him in extensive allusions to feminine
peculiarities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if she doesn&rsquo;t startle you any worse than
that,&rdquo; he hinted darkly.</p>
<p>After dinner, Charlotte was left to a long hour of Mrs.
Snodgrass&rsquo;s company while their husbands reviewed war experiences
and discussed that never-ending theme of exiles, the Government&rsquo;s
Philippine policy. It was ten o&rsquo;clock when the Collingwoods
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>bade good-bye to their hosts, with the usual
promise of an exchange of visits. They found Maclaughlin waiting for
them at the landing with the boat. He asked Mrs. Collingwood if she
could steer and, being told that she could, vacated his place in the
stern for her.</p>
<p>The night was dark but not cloudy, like the previous one. The moon
would not rise till later, but the night azure of the sky was
unclouded, and all the constellations of the tropic belt were
glittering in its peaceful depths. The Southern Cross was there, and
the so-called False Cross, while, in the north, the &ldquo;Big
Dipper&rdquo; hung low and out of place. The water was phosphorescent,
the oars turning in green fire, which sent a million prickles flashing
away in the waves. When, now and then, a <i>banca</i> crept past them,
its shape was outlined in the same lurid radiance, and the noiseless
paddles dripped smears of unearthly flame. Charlotte pulled her tiller
ropes in silence, keeping a wary eye out for unlighted craft, and
watching the huddle of lights that was their launch. The coastguard
cutter had left half an hour before. She was a faint glimmer of dots on
the vague horizon; her smoke still lay a wavering, dark line across the
night sky. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>Suddenly a tremor of deadly fear shook Charlotte. There went the
chain by which she had felt herself linked to the world and
civilization. She had put herself at the mercy of a man of whom she
knew, after all, next to nothing. Once aboard the launch, once out of
Cuyo harbor, she was as utterly in his power as any prisoner in a
dungeon is in the power of his captors. A wife may have rights and
privileges in the eye of the law, but they avail her little on an
island where no one of her own race save her husband&rsquo;s friends
steps foot.</p>
<p>Her crowding thoughts sickened her, though she had enough will and
strength to guide the boat alongside the launch. Collingwood threw away
his cigar and held out his hands. &ldquo;Up with you,&rdquo; he cried
gayly.</p>
<p>The answer was a half movement and a groan as she dropped back with
her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte, are you sick? My God! What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His vehemence and the fear in his voice reassured her. With
indomitable pride she raised herself. &ldquo;My ankle turned; it was
sickening pain for an instant. It is all right, I think. The pain is
growing less.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>She hated herself for the lie. She despised herself for the little
pretence she still made at lameness as her husband would have picked
her up bodily. &ldquo;I can walk,&rdquo; she said, and stepped over the
thwarts.</p>
<p>Maclaughlin had clambered aboard ready to receive her as Martin
lifted her. They put her in the steamer chair which was to serve her as
a stateroom, and Martin hovered over, chafing her hands, offering her
brandy from his pocket flask. Mr. Maclaughlin, after making certain
that she was not seriously hurt, tactfully removed himself. Martin
called to him to wait a minute before pulling out; that it might be
necessary to get a doctor. Charlotte&rsquo;s face burned. She was
grateful for the darkness that hid it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not even sprained,&rdquo; she said truthfully.
&ldquo;There&mdash;see how I can move it. It didn&rsquo;t amount to
anything, only I am such a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure now?&rdquo; said Martin. She was only too glad
to say that she was.</p>
<p>An hour later, a waveless sea was gurgling musically as the launch
cut through it, and a tropical moon was scattering a pathway of
brilliants into which the little craft seemed desirous of plunging
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>herself, but which she could never quite attain.
The Filipino steersman shifted from foot to foot, a dim moving shape at
his shadowed post. Mysterious clanks and groans issued at intervals
from the engine-room below. There was no longer a wavering dark line
across the night sky, though the light on Cuyo was still visible. And
in the exquisite peace a woman, reared to luxury and social
exclusiveness, lay in her deck chair and listened to the talk of men
who had known most of the shadows of life and some of its pits of evil,
took their homage, too, and found it tasty.</p>
<p>Each had drawn up one of the three-legged, rattan stools which are
so common in the Philippines and they were seated one on each side of
her. Their talk wandered over many themes, but was always terse and
vivid. They agreed in damning the Government. All civilian
non-employees do that continually. They spoke of affairs on the island,
and discussed the administration of local justice with the simplicity
of men who do not quibble over political documents, but who have a
strong conviction that the powerful must rule the weak. One of the
Japanese divers was making trouble with the launch crew, preaching the
inferiority of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>white race and the drubbing one part of it
was destined to receive. &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s right on the
Russians,&rdquo; said Collingwood. &ldquo;I believe the Japs will
thrash them into the middle of kingdom come; but if he goes to putting
on any airs around me, I&rsquo;ll kick him into the China
Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; said Maclaughlin cheerily, &ldquo;I did it
for him last week. It did him a world of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are findings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None too good. We&rsquo;ll not make our fortunes this year,
but we&rsquo;ll make our keep, and a little to spare.&rdquo; The smile
on the keen face told Charlotte that the speaker was not
dissatisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Kingsnorth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor devil,&rdquo; said Martin feelingly. Maclaughlin broke
into a hearty laugh. &ldquo;Hear the married man,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; if you could ha&rsquo; heard him six months gone, Mrs.
Collingwood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have liked it,&rdquo; said
Charlotte dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kingsnorth will snort when he hears that Mrs. Snodgrass asked
us to dinner,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like each
other,&rdquo; he explained to his wife. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I ever
thought she liked me <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132"
name="pb132">132</a>]</span>much till this trip. She thinks I&rsquo;m
likelier to be a respectable member of society, now I&rsquo;m married.
She thinks that because I was a soldier I went about sowing wild oats
by the cavan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened that at the moment he finished the remark,
Charlotte&rsquo;s glance rested on Maclaughlin, whose face was fair in
the moonlight. In a flash&mdash;in just the instant&rsquo;s time that
it took him to change his expression&mdash;she read the man&rsquo;s
judgment that Collingwood owed thanks to his wife for any civility
received from Mrs. Snodgrass. A man brought up in the British empire
has some sources of knowledge denied the citizens of our great
republic. Thirty years of kicking over American frontiers had robbed
the Scotchman of many a national trait. They had not obscured his firm
fixed impressions of gentility. He knew Martin&rsquo;s wife for a
gentlewoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you like Mrs. Snodgrass?&rdquo; Martin asked his
wife.</p>
<p>Charlotte cast about for something truthful and non-committal.
&ldquo;I thought she was very prettily dressed,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;and that she showed very good taste in her home. It was cosy,
and the dinner was excellent.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Charlotte! I didn&rsquo;t ask you that. I asked
you how you liked her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told you,&rdquo; said Maclaughlin with a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; echoed Charlotte. &ldquo;I put it in
the most forcible way I could. Don&rsquo;t pretend you did not
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood well enough. I just wanted you to come out and
out with what you mean. Why don&rsquo;t you like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is too commonplace and too assuming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by commonplace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;I mean&mdash;&rdquo; exasperation brought her to
the point of unguarded speech&mdash;&ldquo;a woman who says
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo; with every other breath, or tacks
on a sweet &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think?&rsquo; to qualify every word she utters. I mean a woman of
exactly Mrs. Snodgrass&rsquo;s type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commonplace always means a woman then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But by that time Charlotte was laughing, partly at her flash of
temper, partly at the odd confusion of her definition, which Martin had
so quickly pointed out with his uncompromising finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean a man like you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You are not commonplace, but unique.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one of my kind,&rdquo; said Martin yawning. She
could see, under his jocularity, his pride and pleasure in her (as he
considered) audacity. Her criticisms of the lady meant little to him,
except as they were the gauntlet thrown down, the laudable declaration
that Martin Collingwood&rsquo;s wife was not going to stand any
patronizing from the regular army. But she realized also that he was
flattered by the invitation they had received. To him Lieutenant and
Mrs. Snodgrass were people that counted. A pang of contrition shot
through her that what had been a sort of social triumph to him had been
an unmitigated bore to her. Then a sense of humor came uppermost. The
boredom she might conceal. But as well attempt to make water run up
hill as to make Charlotte Collingwood regard an acquaintance with
Lieutenant and Mrs. Snodgrass as a social triumph. Maclaughlin, who was
to take the first watch, went forward, and Collingwood curled himself
up, native fashion, on a mat at his wife&rsquo;s feet. Long after his
deep respirations told her that he was fast asleep, she lay with wide
open eyes, staring into the silvered pathway ahead of them, her
thoughts a blending of regret and of exquisite joy. When, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>at
three o&rsquo;clock, Maclaughlin came to wake up Martin, she pretended
to be asleep, and shortly after she did fall into a slumber, from which
she was awakened by her husband&rsquo;s voice and the word
&ldquo;home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet with an instinctive movement of bewilderment,
and then caught her breath for sheer delight in what she saw.</p>
<p>The launch was riding a mile or more off the shore of a wedge-shaped
island perhaps three miles in length. Its backbone was a line of hills
which rose precipitously from the sea on the eastern side (as she later
discovered) but which, on the west sloped gently down to a level coast
plain, a quarter of a mile or more broad. The plain and the hills were
one huge cocoanut grove. In the foreground, the columned boles and the
graceful plumes made a great haunt of emerald shade, a dream place of
cool recesses and long cathedral aisles. Its rich, unvarying greenness
seemed the more vivid by contrast with the changing hues of the shallow
water, with the gleaming whiteness of the beach, and the occasional
overtopping of a wave like the dip of a sea-gull&rsquo;s wings.</p>
<p>At the northern apex of the island, situated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>where they not only commanded the western sea,
but looked eastward over a channel to the coast line of Panay and a
scarped mountain rearing its cloud-hung flanks against a lustering sky,
three steep nipa-roofed cottages nestled among the palms. Southward,
the beach line ran straight till it curved out into a sharp point in
front of one of the hills. There stood a small nipa village.</p>
<p>Dawn flushes played across the sky behind the distant mountain, and
pearled the shining sea. A great fishing <i>banca</i> manned by at
least twelve oarsmen swept boldly past them. The naked backs were made
of rippling bronze. A lorcha, almost on the western horizon line,
showed in faint lines and in gleaming spots of mother of pearl. The
morning breeze was almost chill.</p>
<p>It came, a crowding of perceptions and sensations, but
Charlotte&rsquo;s pleasure was almost ecstatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It is a
veritable paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Is</i> it?&rdquo; said Maclaughlin&rsquo;s knowing voice
behind her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so, Mrs. Collingwood. My
wife has been doubting you&rsquo;d find it dull. Martin and I will take
ours with a bandstand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>and a few trolley-cars and a
chop-house thrown in, eh, Collingwood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, Mac, don&rsquo;t pour cold water on my
wife&rsquo;s enthusiasms. Besides, she&rsquo;s got a poetic soul, and
you and I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte stared. &ldquo;What will you endow me with next?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;A poetic soul! Martin, who has been talking about
poetry for the last two months?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind admitting,&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood
shamelessly, &ldquo;that I have, or, at least, I&rsquo;ve been dwelling
on the poetry of love and I found you responsive. Therefore I deduced a
poetic soul&mdash;sort of Sherlock Holmes. Sabe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply beyond one of those reproachful head shakes which
indicate the compromise between duty and inclination. Martin grinned.
He knew when she tried to be severe, but was yet secretly pleased with
him.</p>
<p>Charlotte did what she could to repair the dishevelled appearance
caused by sleeping dressed in the steamer chair. A few minutes later,
they were all in the boat, speeding straight for the nipa cottages.
Martin explained that the launch could go <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>in no further on
account of the coral reef; but, he said, a mile or more to the
southward, where the hill jutted out, there was a channel cut through
the reef, and the launch could come close in and find anchorage in a
pool which lay under the cliff. A rude pier had been constructed there,
and there their freight would be landed and then dragged up to them
along the beach in a carabao cart; for they had one draft animal. He
further informed her that the launch lay down at the anchorage every
night, and came up abreast the cottages every morning to pick up the
fishers, for it was easier to be rowed out than to trudge down the mile
of sand.</p>
<p>As they drew near the shore, Charlotte perceived that, in spite of
the steep roofs, the cottages had something of an American air, having
broad verandas in front; while one, which she imagined must be the
Maclaughlin home, was covered with morning glory vines. The houses sat
back about fifty yards from the beach, just where the cocoanut grove
came to an end, and it was evident that the sea breeze made them
deliciously cool.</p>
<p>A man was pacing up and down the beach, and, as the boat grounded, a
woman emerged from the vine-wreathed cottage, and came swiftly on,
flapping <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>a kitchen apron which she was wearing, and
making other gestures of welcome. Charlotte had little time to observe
either closely, for her attention was quite taken up with the novel
preparations for landing her and her companions. Full thirty feet of
water intervened between them and the dry sand, not deep enough to
drown in, but quite enough to spoil dress and shoes. The Filipino
oarsmen met the difficulty, however, by rolling up their trousers and
going overboard. They made a chair of their clasped hands, and
Charlotte, seating herself therein, was carried ashore and set down in
front of Mrs. Maclaughlin.</p>
<p>Mrs. Maclaughlin was tall and bony with iron-gray hair and a large
featured, strong face, characteristic of the pioneer. She was not shy,
and she seized Mrs. Collingwood by both hands and kissed her, then held
her off for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Martin Collingwood&rsquo;s a fool for luck,&rdquo; she
remarked. &ldquo;I never thought he&rsquo;d get a nice, peart, stylish
girl like you to follow him off to a place like this. You&rsquo;re
either mad&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t look it&mdash;or you&rsquo;re
worse in love than any woman ever was before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The informality of the greeting took Charlotte&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>breath. As she stood blushing, a large, brown,
and well-made hand was extended to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Collingwood?&rdquo; said a voice in the
refined accents of the upper class Englishman. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
need to introduce myself, do I? Martin has told you all about us, and
there are not enough of us to confuse. Don&rsquo;t let Mrs. Mac&rsquo;s
plainness of speech annoy you. When you are well acquainted,
you&rsquo;ll rather like it. It breaks the monotony of
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to make some trivial, laughing rejoinder; but the words
faltered on her lips, for, as she glanced up into his eyes, she saw
there the instant recognition of all that she was, the interrogation
flashing into quickly throttled life, as to why she was Martin
Collingwood&rsquo;s wife, and what she could possibly have to do with a
colony of fisher folk composed of one insouciant blade of fortune, two
typical bits of western flotsam, and a renegade from decent society.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On a certain cloudless September morning eight months
later, five persons were merrily disporting themselves in the warm
billows that rolled upon the island beach. It was one of those
radiantly clear mornings which so often occur in the tropical rainy
seasons when every particle of dust has been washed out of the air, and
the morning breeze is of a spring-like freshness. The sun had not yet
peeped over the Antique coast range, but the mountain flanks were
outlined in soft mauve and gray against the glowing sky. A fishing
fleet off the coast showed tints of pearl, and thin threads of masts
above the quiet sea. Westward there was a sapphire expanse, and a whole
string of lorchas, every inch of canvas set to take advantage of the
fresh wind, standing across on a tack for San Jos&eacute; or Cuyo.</p>
<p>Charlotte Collingwood, slipping out of the water, paused an instant
to breathe deeply and to feast her eyes upon the solitary beauty of the
scene, before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>she betook herself to housekeeping cares. Then
hastening across the short extent of ground between the beach and her
cottage, she sought her bathroom and the brisk dousing with fresh water
that would remove the sticky effects of the sea bath.</p>
<p>Half an hour later she emerged from her bedroom as hearty looking a
young woman as you could desire to see. Her shapely figure, clad in a
simple white piqu&eacute; dress, was considerably fuller than it had
been in her hospital days, though it had not degenerated into
stoutness. Her skin was still colorless, for color once faded in the
tropics is gone forever; but her face was fuller, her eye brighter, her
expression one of happiness and content.</p>
<p>The room which she contemplated with a possessive and complacent eye
was one so typical of American housekeeping in the Philippines that it
merits description. It was a perfectly square apartment, generous in
its proportion. Two sides were almost entirely taken up by windows
opening on a deep-eaved veranda. The series of shell lattices were
pushed back to their fullest extent, and on the broad window-seats were
rows of potted ferns, rose geraniums, and foliage plants, some in
gleaming brass jardini&egrave;res, some in old blue and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>white Chinese jars. The walls were of the
plaited bamboo in its natural color called <i>suali</i>; but the
woodwork of soft American pine had been carefully burnt by Charlotte
herself, and gave some richness of coloring. The floor of close tied
bamboo slats was covered with blue and white Japanese mats. One inside
wall was almost entirely hidden by a great Romblon mat, upon which
Collingwood&rsquo;s collection of spears, bolos, and head axes was
artfully displayed. Beneath this, an army cot, a mattress, and some
blue and white Japanese cr&ecirc;pe had been combined into a tempting
couch heaped with pillows. The other inside wall held a very fair
collection of hats, ranging from the cheap sun-defence of the field
laborer to the old-time aristocrat&rsquo;s head-piece of tortoise-shell
ornamented with silver. Below these were some home-made shelves with
Charlotte&rsquo;s books upon them. One corner was occupied by a desk of
carved teak inlaid with mother of pearl, a veritable treasure which
Kingsnorth had given to Charlotte as a wedding present. Another corner
held a tall, brass-bound Korean chest of drawers, which Charlotte had
picked up at an auction in Manila. A suit of Moro armor in carabao horn
and link copper hung beside <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>this, and everywhere there was
brass&mdash;brass samovars from Manchuria, incense burners from Japan,
Moro gongs and betel-nut boxes, an Indian tea table with its shining
tray. Wherever there was room for them, framed photographs decorated
the walls. Rattan easy-chairs and rockers and a steamer chair with gay
cushions lent a homely comfort to the apartment.</p>
<p>As the room was living-room and dining-room combined, its centre was
occupied by a round narra-table&mdash;a beautiful piece of old Spanish
workmanship, the glories of which were hidden at that moment by the
whitest of cloths&mdash;and a service of Japanese blue and white china.
There, too, gleamed the remains of the Maryland silver which had once
been the pride of a county&mdash;the great breakfast tray with its urn
and attendant dishes, the heavy knives and forks and spoons. It had
lain for twenty years in chests, and Charlotte had brought it with her
to the Philippines, not so much anticipating a use for it, as making it
the evidence of final separation from all that her life had known.</p>
<p>Mrs. Collingwood never ceased to contemplate her living-room, and
especially her table, with satisfaction. The snowy linen, the gleaming
silver and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>glass, stood for her tastes. She could remember
vividly the depression she had experienced at meal times during her
first two weeks at the island, when the mess made its headquarters with
the Maclaughlins. Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s dream of table luxury was a
red and white checked cloth, much colored glass in the form of
tumblers, sugar bowl, cream pitcher, and vinegar cruets, a set of brown
and white &ldquo;semi-porcelain&rdquo; dishes, and knives and forks of
German silver. Charlotte had endured the meals for which Martin had
half-way prepared her, by the exercise of fortitude only; but she had
waited patiently for Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s own suggestion of a
division of labor.</p>
<p>It happened that Mrs. Maclaughlin greatly desired to devote herself
to poultry and gardening. The islanders had to depend wholly upon
poultry, fish, pigs, and goats for meat, and upon tinned vegetables.
Everybody yearned for green foods and better meats, so that Mrs.
Maclaughlin&rsquo;s ambitions received a hearty support. A kitchen was
added to the Collingwood quarters, the stove and kitchen utensils were
transferred, and Charlotte found plenty of occupation in her new
duties.</p>
<p>The work was naturally to her taste. She possessed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>an
ample home-making instinct, and she had had, in addition to the usual
&ldquo;Domestic Science&rdquo; course of a modern college, her
nurse&rsquo;s training in dietetics. Collingwood&rsquo;s exuberant
delight in the changes she made in their manner of living was just
second to Kingsnorth&rsquo;s. For decency&rsquo;s sake, that gentleman
had refrained from comment in Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s presence; but
after their first meal he had taken Mrs. Collingwood aside, and had
assured her with unmistakable sincerity that she was no less than a
fairy godmother in their midst. He execrated Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s
cooking, her taste in foods, and her ideas of table service; and his
gratitude to Charlotte was profound.</p>
<p>Mrs. Collingwood was contemplating her breakfast table and smiling
softly at the memory, when her husband came out of their bedroom in his
working clothes&mdash;flannel shirt, khaki trousers, and sea boots. He
gave her a hearty kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You vain creature,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;looking at your
housekeeping and thinking how you can lay it over Mrs. Mac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be much to do. Do you remember that red
and white tablecloth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I? And how Kingsnorth used to curse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>it!&rdquo; He eyed her reflectively.
&ldquo;Kingsnorth is mighty grateful to you, Charlotte, and mighty fond
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this, at first, no answer was returned. Mrs. Collingwood fingered
a bowl which stood in the window, flushed slightly, and looked
embarrassed. At last, as if his continued silence demanded response,
she said perfunctorily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, if I have made things pleasanter for him,
incidentally, in doing it for you, I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing you&rsquo;ve disappointed me in.
I wanted you and him to be good friends. I think he has tried, but you
have been stubborn; there&rsquo;s no denying that, pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried my very hardest. I&rsquo;m sorry, Martin.
You&rsquo;ll have to give me time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give you all the time you want,&rdquo; he cried gayly.
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to come round in the end.&rdquo; She
shrugged her shoulders half seriously, half teasingly, but a reply was
obviated by the entrance of the Maclaughlins and of the person under
discussion.</p>
<p>The Englishman, beak nosed, high nostrilled, fair, and tall, was
typical of his race. But drink <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148"
href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>had dulled his eye, his skin
was flabby, and an unspeakable air of degeneration hung about him. Even
the exaggerated deference of his manner to Mrs. Collingwood seemed a
travesty upon the once easy courtesy of the well-born Briton. As for
Charlotte, she stiffened perceptibly. Try as she would, she could not
overcome her proud resentment at being expected to associate with John
Kingsnorth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any special plans for to-day, Mrs. Collingwood?&rdquo;
Kingsnorth demanded as they sat down to breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never are any, I believe. I am going to make a lemon
pie under the direct supervision of Mrs. Maclaughlin. My husband has
impressed it upon me that I can never fulfil his ideal of a cook till I
can make such lemon pies as Mrs. Maclaughlin does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a second Kingsnorth&rsquo;s manner changed, just a fine hostile
change which implied that no pie made by Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s
recipes could interest him. &ldquo;With <i>limoncitos</i>&rdquo; he
said slightingly, &ldquo;or with those big knotty yellow things that
the women use in laundering their <i>camisas</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are quite up in native customs,&rdquo; Charlotte
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>exclaimed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that. Are
you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faintly cynical smile played for an instant over
Kingsnorth&rsquo;s features. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>Charlotte became suddenly aware of a changed atmosphere. Martin and
Maclaughlin were looking discreetly into their plates, Mrs. Maclaughlin
was gazing with a hostile eye at Kingsnorth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly do know a great deal about Filipino
customs,&rdquo; she said meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep still, Jenny,&rdquo; Maclaughlin threw in hastily.
His wife tossed her head scornfully, but subsided. Kingsnorth went on
eating. His expression was not agreeable. Charlotte threw herself into
the silence that followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin, who is that bucolic looking Japanese that I saw
strolling up the beach this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bucolic! What do you mean by that long word? You are always
springing the dictionary upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This charge was an indication that Collingwood was highly pleased.
It was the nearest open tribute he ever paid to his wife&rsquo;s
education. She made no reply but smiled at him, indulgent of his wit.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, explain,&rdquo; Martin went on teasingly. &ldquo;What
does it mean?&rdquo; But Charlotte only went on smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greek for hayseed,&rdquo; Kingsnorth put in lightly.
&ldquo;You know <i>that</i> word, Collingwood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are. He is a hayseed. That is our new diver. He
came down on the lorcha last week, and we picked him up with the
launch. Been promenading around here, did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In kimono and parasol,&rdquo; said Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he goes to work to-morrow. He won&rsquo;t get much more
time to parade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you three divers, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The fellow that Mac kicked hasn&rsquo;t been able to get
over it. He resigned immediately, but I succeeded in convincing him
that he couldn&rsquo;t quit the job till I got a new man in his place.
I believe he wants to go to law about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he make any trouble? Isn&rsquo;t that taking the law into
your own hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shrugged his shoulders. Kingsnorth laughed. &ldquo;It would
be dangerous on British soil,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not under the
great republic. Who is going to tack back and forth across this channel
in a lorcha or a parao, because a Jap got kicked? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>His
nearest magistrate is a Filipino <i lang="es">juez de paz</i> on the
Antique coast. I wish him joy of all the law he can get there. When it
comes to the island of Maylubi, Martin, Mac, and I are the law.
&lsquo;<i lang="fr">L&rsquo;&eacute;tat, c&rsquo;est
nous.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Collingwood smiled discreetly at the French, and pushed her
chair back. Kingsnorth often threw a phrase of French into his speech,
and she felt that it was aimed directly at her, and implied an
exclusion of the others from their superior plane of conversation. It
was not an act characteristic of an Englishman of his class, and she
realized that only the intensity of his desire to establish himself on
a footing of intimacy could induce him to use such methods.</p>
<p>They all walked down to the beach together, and after Charlotte had
watched their row-boat pull alongside the launch, she sat down on a bit
of sand grass beneath a cocoanut tree and revelled in the morning
breeze. It was a &ldquo;four man breeze&rdquo; as they say when four
men are needed on the outriggers of the <i>paraos</i>; and more than
one deep-sea fishing craft swept by with its four naked squatting
outriders sitting at ease on their well sprayed stations with the great
sail bellying above them. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>the tide went out, troops of
children wandered up the beach, digging skilfully with their toes for
clams, or pouncing with shrieks of delight on some stranded jelly fish.
From the field beyond the house, their gardener could be heard hissing
at their one draft animal, and once in awhile Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s
voice arose in a rain of pigeon Spanish as she bent over her garden
beds, or ranged through her poultry yards.</p>
<p>It was very lonely, but Charlotte did not mind it. Barring the
discomforts of their experiences in the early days with Mrs.
Maclaughlin&rsquo;s food, and the difficulty of holding John Kingsnorth
in his place without betraying her feelings about him to Martin, she
might have said that her island life hardly boasted of the crumpled
rose leaf. Even Kingsnorth&rsquo;s evident determination to be accepted
as an intimate, did not imply a desire to establish any sentimental
relation to herself, nor could she explain to her whole satisfaction
just why she so vigorously thwarted him. She was only conscious of
feeling that to accept his tacit offer of good fellowship was a clearly
defined step downward, an open throwing over of standards which, if she
had endangered them by her marriage, she had still high hopes of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>maintaining, and to which she hoped ultimately
to win her husband.</p>
<p>On the whole, her thoughts were very sweet and wholesome as she sat
there in the growing warmth. More than once a sense of housekeeping
responsibility urged her to rise and betake herself indoors, but she
could not bring herself to disturb her reverie till a respectful cough
attracted her attention.</p>
<p>An old man and a young girl, carrying a child in her arms, stood a
few feet away. The man was dressed in spotless white trousers with a
Chinese shirt of white muslin. One sleeve was decorously adorned with a
black mourning band, and his white bamboo plaited hat was also wreathed
in sable. The girl was dressed in the deepest of Filipino
mourning&mdash;black calico skirt, black alpaca <i>tapis</i>, or apron,
and a <i>camisa</i> of thin barred black net, shiny and stiff with
starch. Through its gauzy texture her white chemise, trimmed with
scarlet embroidery, showed garishly, while the immense sleeves made no
pretence of hiding her plump, gold-colored arms. Her face, of a very
<span class="corr" id="xd20e1572" title=
"Source: Malayasian">Malaysian</span> type, was decidedly pretty, and
the haughty column of her neck and a wealth of jetty hair lent still
further charm. As she caught Charlotte&rsquo;s eye, she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>stepped forward, throwing back, as she did so,
the black veil which had hidden the child&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s first exclamation of surprise and pity was
followed by an indignant flush. The child, which was evidently dying of
an&aelig;mia, was a <i>mestizo</i>. Its blue eye, its almost fair hair
above a pasty skin and something indefinably British in the stamp of
its expression betrayed its paternity at once.</p>
<p>The man spoke neither Spanish nor English, and the girl had only a
few phrases of each; but with Charlotte&rsquo;s command of the
vernacular she managed to get a few facts in some sort of sequence. For
brevity and to spare the reader an elliptical conversation in three
languages they can be set down as Charlotte summed them up
afterwards.</p>
<p>The man was the child&rsquo;s grandfather; the girl, its aunt. Its
mother had died a week or so before at a village on the Antique coast.
The woman and her people had lived with Kingsnorth openly in his house
up to the morning of the <i>se&ntilde;ora Americana&rsquo;s</i>
arrival. At that time Kingsnorth had come in in great excitement, had
bundled them all off in short order, and had established them in the
coast village. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>As he was their only source of income, they
accepted his mandate without question.</p>
<p>But the mother had died, of what they could not make quite clear,
though the girl pressed her hands upon her heart and repeated
&ldquo;<i>muy, muy triste</i>&rdquo; more than once. After the
mother&rsquo;s death, the baby lacked nourishment, though its father
gave money to buy milk. They had come over on a fish <i>parao</i> to
show it to its father, and had received orders to keep out of Mrs.
Collingwood&rsquo;s way; but hearing from the villagers of that
lady&rsquo;s skill in curing the sick and of her willingness to use it,
they could not forbear bringing the child to her. But with tears, they
besought her to keep the secret. The old man made a very fair
representation of bestowing a hearty kick, and the girl, weeping,
ejaculated &ldquo;<i>Pega, pega mucho</i>,&rdquo; many times.</p>
<p>Charlotte had been interested during her hospital experience in a
series of experiments made by one of the surgeons in infant-feeding.
The mortality among Filipino children is enormous, and much attention
is given to infant care. It happened that she had been trying the food
process on one or two babies in the village, and it was doubtless the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>news of that fact which had induced the people
to risk Kingsnorth&rsquo;s anger and appeal to her.</p>
<p>She led them homeward, gave the child some nourishment, and set to
work to show the girl how to prepare the canned milk for future use. It
was not till they had departed that she realized that they had not said
whether or <span class="corr" id="xd20e1609" title=
"Source: no">not</span> the mother had been legally married. Later she
decided that the fact was immaterial, but she was inclined to believe
the child illegitimate.</p>
<p>For the next ten days the girl presented herself with the child for
treatment. She watched carefully to see that the fishers had gone each
day, and that Mrs. Maclaughlin was not around. The child thrived, and
with returning health showed a somewhat engaging appearance.</p>
<p>Charlotte could never be quite certain of her reasons for keeping
silence to her husband on the subject. At first undoubtedly she desired
to avoid making trouble for the old man and the girl; but later, when
Mrs. Maclaughlin had met the girl face to face on Charlotte&rsquo;s
veranda steps, and she knew the fact had been retailed to Maclaughlin
and to the other men, she was still wordless. For a few days the sullen
demeanor of Kingsnorth showed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157"
href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>that he dumbly resented her
knowledge; but in the end his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> established
themselves in the village, and when Charlotte walked that way she often
saw his taffy-colored son, in a single garment, staring with
incongruous blue eyes from the floor of a nipa shack.</p>
<p>What was stranger, even, than anything else, Mrs. Maclaughlin showed
an eager desire to avoid the subject. Charlotte had anticipated, with
some dread, that the lady would break forth garrulously once the cat
was out of the bag; but she was most pleasantly disappointed. Between
herself and Martin the matter was never mentioned. There were times
when she would have liked to ask him what he had really expected her to
do before Kingsnorth saved the situation by packing off his
<i>impedimenta</i>; but she was afraid that, if the subject were ever
opened up between them, she would express herself too frankly, and she
was too thoroughly happy with her husband to care to risk disturbing
their satisfaction in each other. As time went on, she ceased to give
the matter any thought at all. After all, she reflected, had she not
known it all potentially the first time she ever saw Kingsnorth? What
did the addition of a few specific <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158"
href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>data matter? At that time all
her will was bent to the determination to make the best of her romance,
to be happy at any cost, and to postpone indefinitely, if not
ultimately, any hour of settlement. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Want a paseo, Charlotte?&rdquo; Martin called
from his deck chair on the vine-shaded veranda one Sunday afternoon.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so very hot. I feel like walking
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Collingwood, who was dabbing a powder puff across her face as a
finish to her afternoon toilet, responded at once, from the adjoining
bedroom, that she was longing for a walk. In a few minutes, she
appeared, tying the strings of a great sun hat, and handed her umbrella
to Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I got to lug this thing?&rdquo; he groaned; but even as
he spoke, he opened it and held it tenderly over her.</p>
<p>Kingsnorth, smoking on his own veranda, nodded and asked them where
they were going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most anywhere. Up the hill, probably. Charlotte likes to go
there. Will you come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Collingwood did not second the invitation, though she had time
to do so before Kingsnorth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too
lazy. I&rsquo;ll leave hill-climbing to you adventurous young
persons.&rdquo; To himself he added, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me.
You want to go up there and spoon. Oh, Lord! to be young again!&rdquo;
He did not add, &ldquo;and to love and be loved&rdquo;; but the words
were bitter in his thoughts as he watched the young couple go along the
clean beach.</p>
<p>When they came to a path leading across the cocoanut grove to a spur
of hill on the eastern side of the island, they took it, followed it
through the shadowed green arcades, climbed a rather stiff hill, and,
at length, found themselves in the shade of a bamboo clump at the head
of a cleft filled with undergrowth. An outcropping of rock made a sort
of natural seat for Charlotte, and Collingwood stretched himself at her
feet. On the ridge above them a line of cocoanut trees drooped their
great leaves, while over their heads the long bamboo stems swayed to
every breath of air. Although the elevation was low&mdash;not more than
fifty or sixty feet above the water&mdash;it gave the loungers an
extended view. The sea rolled in long swells of deepest sapphire. Far
away to the north, the great plateau mountain of Tablas was a violet
shadow in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>sky; but on the east the insistent sun searched
out every ravine and spur of the Antique coast range. From that grim
mountain king which lords it over them on the north to the far distance
of the south their weathered sides lay outlined in long lines of pink
and mauve, and in great patches of smoky-blue, where cloud shadows lay
soft upon them. Here and there a distant sail gleamed, a mere speck of
pearl against the lustre of sea and sky, and, in the north, a
steamer&rsquo;s smudge was plainly visible, though the vessel was hull
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be a tramp freighter going north, which slipped through
the channel without our noticing her,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;This
is not the time for the Puerta Princesa steamer.&rdquo; Boats were
always a source of conversation at the island. They were charged with
almost a romantic significance, coming and going, ever the mute
reminders that, beyond the shining horizon line, people still lived and
toiled, still built and populated the great cities of which Martin
loved to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a line of smoke without a pang of
homesickness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. We are thirteen
hours ahead of Chicago time. It is now about four o&rsquo;clock;
it&rsquo;s quiet enough in those empty <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>streets now. But
about the time we were eating lunch, the theatres were just emptying. I
can see the carriages drive up, and the women with their beautiful
dresses showing under their opera cloaks; and the other kind, the kind
that don&rsquo;t go in carriages, hurrying off to catch a car,
buttoning up their jackets as they come out into the
cool&mdash;it&rsquo;s just frosty weather there now&mdash;and the
lights in the big restaurants, and the lamps flashing on carriages and
automobiles. Meanwhile, we are here frizzling, and here we bid fair to
stay till we make money enough to go home in style. I shall take you to
the theatre some time that way, Charlotte. You&rsquo;ll be in a
low-necked dress with diamonds&mdash;do you think you&rsquo;ll like
diamonds?&mdash;and you shall have one of those long coats with the
hoods, and I&rsquo;ll be in my swallow-tail. We&rsquo;ll spin up in an
electric brougham, and rustle into our box. Then, after the
performance, we&rsquo;ll have a supper, and then I&rsquo;ll say
&lsquo;Home&rsquo; kind of careless to the chauffeur. How does that
strike your imagination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lay at her feet, smiling, and Charlotte hardly knew what to
reply. How could she say to him that the experience on which his whole
imagination had fastened was a matter of fact detail of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>her
past? She had rarely entered a theatre except under the circumstances
which had made it a picture of delight to him. She did not deny that it
would be pleasant to go again, and she did not, for an instant,
underrate the pleasure which comes of knowing oneself among the envied
few. But how could she take from him the pleasure of anticipating for
her as well as for himself? Indeed, would not it make a perceptible
rift in his present joy if he knew that his innocent outburst could
find no echo in her breast? Would he not feel a little ridiculous? And
how uncomfortable it was that that coil of misunderstanding always was
most perceptible at Martin&rsquo;s most exalted moments! Why had he
chosen to assume that she was a stranger to luxury, and why had her
good taste so resolutely declined to give him even a hint, until
suddenly she found herself in a position where a hint would seem like
an insult? She would have liked to tell him, then and there, a string
of reminiscences, and to share half a hundred memories with him, but it
was too late. To say anything then would be to pour cold water by the
bucket over his enthusiasms. What she did say was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall enjoy that immensely if it ever comes; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>but
until it does come, I want you to understand that I am not discontented
with our life here; and that if it never comes, I shall not let myself
repine over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that,&rdquo; he replied earnestly. And as she
smiled at him faintly, puzzled by his emphasis, he added, &ldquo;I took
my chances when I brought you here, and there is no doubt that you are
an unusual woman to have stood it as you have done. The queer part of
it is that I knew what risks I was taking, but until it was too late to
back out, I couldn&rsquo;t own them to myself. One of the reasons that
I wanted you so badly was that I hated it so here, and it was so
all-fired lonely. But I kept on saying to myself that it wouldn&rsquo;t
be lonely for you because I would be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she conceded, willing to gloss over the
selfishness of which he stood ready to accuse himself, &ldquo;so long
as you are willing to believe that you would not be lonely because I
would be here, that seems a fair exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t fair at any point, because I knew exactly
what the place was like and you were going into it blindfold. But a man
can&rsquo;t stop to look at things that way. If we did, nobody would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>ever get anything in the world that he wanted.
My mother used to say to me that God helps those who help themselves.
I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that He doesn&rsquo;t do anything of
the kind, but that He sits back and doesn&rsquo;t interfere with those
who take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this burst of unusual eloquence, Mr. Collingwood closed his
eyes and puffed luxuriously at his cigar. But for the rhythm of the
surf, nature seemed steeped in afternoon slumber. In the accentuated
silence the voices of children digging clams far up the beach came to
them like drowsy music.</p>
<p>Collingwood smoked on, content with his own analysis of his conduct
and delighting in his wife&rsquo;s soft hand on his brow. Charlotte
thought he was going to sleep, and smiled tenderly at his closed eyes.
Martin not infrequently displayed his enjoyment of her society by a
willingness to nap in it; but she was not petty enough to grudge him
the indulgence. Besides, many of her tenderest thoughts, her best
inspirations had come to her as she mused, on lazy afternoons, with his
handsome profile in her lap. There seemed, at such times, to be a
reversal of their ordinary relations. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>leaned tremendously
on Martin, not by making him a sharer in her domestic difficulties or
by wearying him, already weary with toil, by that demand for petty
services by which some women delight to vaunt their possession of a
slave. As far as she could be a buffer between him and all the little
cares and burdens of their daily life, Charlotte had kept her promise
to herself to make Martin Collingwood a good wife. And though she
measured his hourly joy in the pride of having her undivided affection,
she felt herself meanly stinting him of that secret hoard of gratitude
which lay so warm in her heart. Was he fairly treated, she asked
herself, in being denied the knowledge that he alone of all the world
had made her feel herself welcome in it? He thought her strong, when,
in reality, all her strength came from him. Deprived of that crown and
sceptre with which he had endowed her, would she be more than a poor
shrinking outcast again, a creature at bay, ready to snap without
discrimination at passing curiosity or at passing kindness. But pride
was still strong in her heart&mdash;love had not subdued that; and
there were some explanations that she could not force herself to make.
When he lay supine, as on that afternoon, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>his pagan beauty even
more markedly defined by a slumber that was like a child&rsquo;s, she
had an intuition of his unexpressed dependence on her. Was it possible
that Martin had reservations also? The thought bred another. Is it
possible for any soul to unbosom itself completely to another? Does not
the very wealth of confidence entrain some final reservations, the
inner sanctuary of that self-dignity with which the-gentlest spirit is
reluctant to part? She decided that, freely as he revealed himself to
her, Martin must carry deep in his heart, some feelings jealously
guarded from her&mdash;thoughts and feelings perhaps that he had
recklessly revealed to the young girls who at times had fired his
imagination. It is the instinct of the human soul to guard those
weaknesses of which it is self-conscious from those natures which
cannot understand them, and, not understanding, cannot sympathize. Of
what weakness did she make Martin self-conscious? She knew only too
well the weaknesses of which he made her self-conscious; knew, too, her
desperate fear that full cognizance of them might shake the foundations
of his pride in her. They had been married eight months, and in that
time they had hardly touched a jar in their lives. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>had
told her a thousand times that she was all the world to him, and she
had replied a thousand times that she asked nothing more, and that, so
long as she could be that, she was willing to bear solitude, and endure
even privation. Was all her happiness hinged upon the chance dropping
of a curtain in his speech or hers? upon the revelation of another self
hidden away behind his merriment, behind her silence? She sighed and
moved impatiently, trying to shake off her thoughts. Then she
remembered that he was sleeping and glanced down to find him gazing at
her quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been awake all the while,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;watching your face. You have been doing a sight of thinking all
to yourself. You thought I had dropped off, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had reason to believe you capable of it,
Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I have done and what I am going to do this afternoon are
two distinct things, Mrs. C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Martin, I hate &lsquo;Mrs. C.&rsquo; It sounds like
Dickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean <i>the</i> dickens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: if it comes to that, I&rsquo;ll use the other
word&mdash;the one you are so fond of using.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Collingwood almost sat up. &ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re coming
on,&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d never have said that when
we were first married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s tone left
open an inference which her husband must have perceived, for he laughed
contentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>were</i> mealy-mouthed,&rdquo; he stated, with a
genial retrospect in his voice.</p>
<p>Charlotte looked at him demurely. &ldquo;I was brought up to observe
the conventional limitations of feminine speech, dear; but if your
heart is set upon my enlarging upon them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; Martin ejaculated piously, as she came
to her suggestive little pause. He added after a moment, &ldquo;But I
had a girl once that used to swear. It never sounded bad in her. It was
just funny and cute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there was one habit of Martin Collingwood&rsquo;s that came near
rousing a visible resentment in his wife, it was his easy-going
references to his &ldquo;girls.&rdquo; She knew that the term, as he
used it, implied no disrespect, that it was his equivalent for
<i>innamorata</i>, and that each affair with a girl had represented one
of his tentative ventures toward matrimony. She was not jealous of her
predecessors in his affections, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>for there was an overwhelming
sincerity in his invariable reassurance that none of them &ldquo;came
up to specifications&rdquo;; that is, conformed to his ideal of
womanhood, as she herself did. Nor did he hesitate to reveal that, in
most cases, the breaking of sentimental ties was largely the result of
his own initiative. If his frankness in these revelations had contained
one element of personal vanity, it would have strained dangerously his
wife&rsquo;s respect for him. But although he had a happy
self-confidence, Collingwood was utterly without self-conscious vanity.
Charlotte realized, also, that his good looks and his personal charm
which she, with her critically developed faculties, had been unable to
withstand, must have made him an exceedingly popular swain with the
type of young woman whom he had previously affected. But it was
irritating to have him lump her with them so carelessly. It implied
that, though she was the only perfect jewel according to his taste, the
matter was, after all, one of taste and not of kind. She was human
enough, however, to suffer some pangs of curiosity concerning her
erstwhile rivals, and though she would not have asked a question,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>she was not dissatisfied when Martin went
on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny what differences there are in people. You
are not glum, but you don&rsquo;t laugh much. Even when you seem
happiest, you are rather grave and quiet. But that girl giggled from
morning till night, and she made me laugh too. She saw the funny side
of everything that happened, and she was no fool either. She was quick
as a flash. The last time I saw her was at the close of the Spanish
War. It was about ten days before I enlisted. The Government sent a
gunboat up the Mississippi River just to show the backwoods people what
a real live gunboat that had been in the war looked like; and those
blamed officers were making love to every pretty girl on both banks of
the river wherever the boat lay long enough to have a reception for the
officers or a smoker for the men. This girl was dancing with a
sandy-haired little ensign, and he was piling it on thick as molasses
on a hot cake. All of a sudden, she began to giggle. He wanted to know
why. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a horse you&rsquo;re married,&rdquo; she
said over his shoulder; and the fellow, like to split himself laughing,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>vowed he wasn&rsquo;t. But when he got to St.
Louis, there it was in the papers, how his wife had come out to join
him for that week. When his boat went back down the river the next
week, all the girls gave him the laugh. That little devil had told it
on him, and all the talk he had given her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that girl,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;What became
of her? How did it happen that you didn&rsquo;t make the best of your
opportunities in her case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. She had me mighty anxious. But she played just a
little too bluff a game. She got hold of a long-legged sergeant of
volunteers and she let on that she didn&rsquo;t have a minute to give
me after he came along. I used to walk home from church with her pretty
regularly, but the first Sunday after she picked up with him, she
turned me down. I had to come along behind with her best friend: she
was one of those girls that always have neglected women friends and run
&lsquo;em in and make you be civil to &lsquo;em. I hated this other
girl, and I was the maddest man that ever tagged up the street after
his girl and another man. All of a sudden, I saw that every time she
took a step, she turned the hem of her skirt with her heel. You know I
just came to myself. I got to wondering if I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>wanted to marry a girl with a jay-bird heel like
that, and I decided I didn&rsquo;t. I enlisted, came out here, served
my country in China, and took back talk from a lot of West Point
popinjays for two years&mdash;damn their souls&mdash;and that was all
the patriotism I had. She married her volunteer and he served his three
years and got a commission. I saw by a paper not very long ago that
they are in Samar now. She was a good fellow, that girl. I should like
to see her again. If the fool killer tried to kill her, the gun
wouldn&rsquo;t go off, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite so,&rdquo; Charlotte replied gravely, and then,
as Martin relapsed into laziness again, she remained studying him and
pondering the somewhat irrelevant motives which had influenced his
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A jay-bird heel!&rdquo; She looked with amused scrutiny at
his somewhat emphasized masculine beauty. What magnificence, what
unconscious arrogance of self-esteem lay unrebuked in this innocent
youth; for in spite of the fact that he had known sin as she had never
known it, that his unrestrained instincts had reached forth into
experiments with life from which not only her sex, but the inheritance
of tradition and of environment had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>eternally debarred
her&mdash;in spite of these facts, Charlotte had always a sense of
cynical and satiated age beside his debonair innocence. It had been her
lot to be both player and onlooker in that melodrama where the
possession of ample means and the development of critical and
&aelig;sthetic faculties have frowned upon the expression of a direct
and creative ambition; and yet, where all that is subtly ambitious, and
all that is meanly jealous, and all that is secretly arrogant, deprived
of a natural and healthy expression, underlie and taint the whole body
of society. She had come to realize that, in that world in which money
must not be mentioned, money is the most indispensable necessity; that
every instinct tabooed as vulgar has been so tabooed, because, when it
is no longer recognized in speech, it may be the more successfully
pursued in action. She had discovered that the exquisite charm of
manner which is called high-bred unconsciousness is the result of a
self-consciousness so unflagging that its possessor is incapable of
losing herself utterly in any emotion; and that the final result of the
developing process is an individuality whose utter selfishness and
nullity are not patent simply because all the arts of society and all
the material advantages of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>wealth are bent to the concealment
of the truth. Collingwood was, as he had said of his sweetheart,
&ldquo;no fool.&rdquo; He had a keen interest in life, a rather broad
knowledge of men and affairs as they are judged by concrete results;
but of that sense of social values which amounts almost to a cult with
our so-called aristocratic classes, Martin was as ignorant as his
primeval parents were of sin. Suddenly, as she looked at him, a
quotation flashed into Charlotte&rsquo;s mind. She formed the words
with her lips as her memory groped for them:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The ancients set no value on that half feminine
delicacy, that nervous sensibility which we call distinction, and on
which we pride ourselves. For the <i>distingu&eacute;</i> man of the
present day, a salon is necessary; he is a <i>dilettante</i> and
entertaining with ladies; although capable of enthusiasms, he is
inclined to scepticism; his politeness is exquisite; he dislikes foul
hands and disagreeable odors, and shrinks from being confounded with
the vulgar. Alcibiades had no apprehension of being confounded with the
vulgar.</p>
</div>
<p>Martin opened his eyes as she was breathing the words to herself,
but she did not stop. He stared at her, and when she paused, he
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of hoodoo was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, O my Alcibiades, was a charm.&rdquo; She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>leaned forward and kissed him&mdash;a half
repentant, wholly tender little caress. It pleased him, for while she
was ready enough to be petted, Charlotte was slow to offer endearments.
Lifelong habit was stronger even than the impulses of a naturally
demonstrative nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you hoodooing? Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: myself. It was I that needed the charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are getting mysterious again. Tell me what it was
about.&rdquo; Collingwood had, when he desired to wheedle, not only a
child&rsquo;s persistency but a child&rsquo;s alluringness. Charlotte
had had experience in plenty with him, and knew her own weakness in
resisting him. She cast a hasty glance around and perceived the
steamer, the smoke of which had been visible when they gained the hill.
They had, in seating themselves, half turned their backs in her
direction, and she had crept very close to the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin, that boat seems to be coming nearer. She would not
come this close if she were heading for Cuyo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! Here?&rdquo; Collingwood raised himself alertly and
stared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange. Coastguard. She isn&rsquo;t making
Iloilo, or she would not be cutting <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>across our bows; but
it is a queer route for Cuyo. Why didn&rsquo;t she cut over to the west
after leaving Romblon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to signal her for information,
Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Information be blanked. I&rsquo;ll signal her for fresh beef
if she gets close enough. We may be able to exchange a bit of fish.
Have you seen the fish <i>parao</i> go in yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It went by a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Maybe we had better go down and be ready
to trade if she comes near enough. I&rsquo;ll send out a note with the
launch. It looks, though, as if she were heading straight for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would a coastguard steamer drop mail here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: catch a Government captain dropping an anchor to oblige
anybody. If she is coming in, it is either with somebody interested in
pearl fishery statistics, or some sort of survey, or&mdash;&rdquo; he
turned suddenly, a teasing smile melting all his handsome features to
winningness&mdash;&ldquo;your friend Barton. Didn&rsquo;t he promise us
a visit sometime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin had assumed a marital jocularity on the subject of the Judge.
Charlotte had honestly but vainly tried to dispel from his mind his
strong conviction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178"
name="pb178">178</a>]</span>that Judge Barton was a rival who had
hardly been allowed to approach the tentative stages of worship. Her
quick frown and &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; only made her husband grin
more broadly. &ldquo;That was a mere civility at parting,&rdquo; she
insisted. &ldquo;Judge Barton hasn&rsquo;t a particle of interest in
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any in me, certainly; and he would be
justified in not having any in you. Snapped his nose off, you did,
every time he opened his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin, you do not understand. I tried my best to be
agreeable to Judge Barton, just as any nurse ought to be to any
patient; and every time I &lsquo;snapped his nose off&rsquo; as you
express it, I did it in self-defence. He was very often impertinent to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Charlotte, I heard pretty near every word he ever said to
you, and I never heard anything out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were going down hill by that time, Martin ahead, picking the
trail; and Charlotte made a quaintly affectionate grimace behind his
sturdy back. There were various reasons why she was unwilling to make
any effort to enlighten Martin&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>denseness. There was
no earthly danger of his appreciating unaided the delicate flavor of
Judge Barton&rsquo;s impertinence.</p>
<p id="citation">&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she remarked, deftly slipping
from the discussion of facts upon which disagreement was certain,
&ldquo;he will have forgotten both of us completely by this time, and
there is not one chance in a hundred of his being on that boat if it
does stop here.&rdquo; But Martin had time to correct her. He was
willing to admit that there was not much certainty of the Judge&rsquo;s
being on the boat unless she stopped; and then he stood ready to back
his judgment. By the time they had crossed the cocoanut grove and had
gained the beach, it was evident that the boat was making for the
island. Kingsnorth had sighted her, and had sent out the launch, which
was puffing busily toward her. &ldquo;Kingsnorth&rsquo;s got as good a
nose for fresh beef as I have,&rdquo; Collingwood grunted approvingly.
The Maclaughlins were on their veranda with a pair of binoculars, and
some excitement could be perceived even in the distant village.</p>
<p>The steamer slowed up in reply to signals from the launch, and
evidently awaited advice about dropping anchor. When she did come to a
halt, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>however, and put a boat out, Martin counted the
persons who descended into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distinguished passengers,&rdquo; he remarked concisely.
&ldquo;The captain would not put out the gang-way for his own use in
that sea. Three men in white suits; three rowers; and the skipper is
coming along. We&rsquo;re in for visitors, Charlotte. What is there for
dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte was away on the instant. He heard her despatching
boys&mdash;one to the village, bidding him secure the very best of the
afternoon&rsquo;s catch; another to the poultry yard with orders to
bring up the two fattest capons, but not to slay them till further
orders. Complaining shrieks of the storeroom door, the hinges of which
were exceedingly rusty, bore testimony to repeated openings; and the
voice of old Pedro was audible, cursing the ice-machine.</p>
<p>By the time the boat was close in, the sun was fairly low and seemed
to be sucking up the whole Visaya Sea is shafts of splendor. As soon as
the narrowing distance permitted the little crafts&rsquo; passengers to
be recognized, Collingwood cocked a humorous eye upon his wife and went
into silent ecstasies of laughter, much to the amazement of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>Kingsnorth and the Maclaughlins. Charlotte
blushed, bit her lips and then she laughed also, at first in helpless
embarrassment, and finally with a sheer burst of merriment. She had
barely time to recover her gravity when the boat grounded, and Judge
Barton, as an acquaintance, took precedence of his fellow-passengers,
and was carried ashore in time to introduce them as they landed. All
had to avail themselves of the primitive transporting process by which
Charlotte herself had made her landing, and it was in no hateful spirit
that she admitted that dignity and such a progress are almost
incompatible. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=

<h2 id="xd20e1818" class="main">Chapter IX</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is an unexpected pleasure, murmured Mrs.
Collingwood, giving to Judge Barton a warm pressure of the hand. For
though she was proud and sensitive, she was not vindictive, and the
Judge&rsquo;s conduct on her wedding day had gone far to blot out the
recollection of their of their unamicable past. Also his presence was a
compliment, an assurance that his professions of interest were not
wholly perfunctory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should not be so,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;What did I
tell you on your wedding day? You&rsquo;ve forgotten. I haven&rsquo;t,
you see, and here I am! Moreover, I have brought you a commissioner and
a gentleman interested in pearl shells.&rdquo; By the time he had
finished this long speech, the Judge had shaken hands with both husband
and wife, and stood ready to introduce the men who followed him. They
were respectively a member of the Philippine Commission and an American
agent for a button factory in the United States, who was desirous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>of making arrangements for a permanent supply of
shells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Commissioner is headed for Cuyo, and will go on there
to-morrow,&rdquo; said Judge Barton. &ldquo;Mr. Jones would like to
stay and see the field and talk business with Mr. Collingwood until the
steamer returns, in about a week; and I have wondered if you could put
up with me that long also. But nobody is to be inconvenienced. Knowing
the limited resources of islands in the Visaya Sea, each of us has come
provided with an army cot and bedding, and we have also a first-class
shelter tent. Likewise, remembering Mr. Collingwood&rsquo;s
reminiscences in hospital, and being minded of the scarcity of fresh
beef, I ventured to bring along the quarter of a cow&mdash;I believe a
part of the hind quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further. Martin had again taken his hand between two
bronzed paws and was shaking it fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Judge,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;just why you
hold your eminent position. A man can&rsquo;t be great these days
without a head for detail, and you have one. There are plenty of men
who would have forgotten all I said about this place, but you
haven&rsquo;t. You remembered it at the right time. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>Now,
frankly, Judge, where is that beef at the present moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Judge hooked a thumb in the direction of the steamer&rsquo;s
boat. &ldquo;<i>That</i> beef is in <i>that</i> dinghey,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;and, without desiring to advise Mrs. Collingwood in her
domestic arrangements, I should suggest that the sooner it is eaten the
better. The steamer&rsquo;s ice-carrying facilities are limited, and it
is by the grace of God that it has &lsquo;kept&rsquo; till
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means by the grace of Government coal, Mrs.
Collingwood,&rdquo; interrupted the steamer&rsquo;s captain, who was
standing by talking to Kingsnorth, whom he knew. &ldquo;I had nearly to
ruin my engines getting that beef down here, the Judge was so concerned
about it.&rdquo; It came ashore at that minute, a suggestively dead
piece of beef in cheese-cloth wrappings, but the fishers received it
almost with rites of welcome.</p>
<p>Kingsnorth and the Maclaughlins having been presented, the group
wandered leisurely toward the Collingwood cottage. The newcomers
protested that there was no need of Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s giving
herself trouble about dinner; they could go back to the steamer for
dinner; it would be waiting for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185"
href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>them. It was the stereotyped
convention throughout a land where hospitality is as catholic as is the
necessity for it. Martin and Charlotte, naturally, would hear nothing
of the visitors&rsquo; returning to the steamer before bedtime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind dinner&rsquo;s being a little
late,&rdquo; Charlotte added, while Mrs. Maclaughlin threw in, in
response to a last weak protest, &ldquo;Trouble! Why we would cook for
twenty people to get to talk to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the boat went back for the tent, the cots, and the luggage of the
prospective guests, while the visitors sat on Charlotte&rsquo;s
veranda, enjoying the evening breeze and the sunset, as they drank tea
and consumed delicious little triangles of buttered toast, and slices
of sweet cake. The Commissioner wanted to know all about the island:
who owned it? what crops did it produce? was there an intelligent
<i>teniente</i>? &ldquo;He obeys the orders that we give him,&rdquo;
replied Martin dryly, and the Commissioner smiled: Was there easy
communication with the mainland? What did Mr. Collingwood think of
coprax in the Visayas? Then, in an aside, to Charlotte, What a pity
that he had not brought Mrs. Commissioner! she would have enjoyed this.
Such a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>charming situation and such a delightful home!
Mrs. Commissioner would never cease to regret having missed it.
&ldquo;We hope that you will have occasion to pass again, and will
bring her with you,&rdquo; Charlotte murmured politely, and the great
man assured her that he should make a point of it. &ldquo;She loves
atmosphere,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have more of that than anything
else,&rdquo; Kingsnorth interjected, and to the Commissioner&rsquo;s
hearty laugh, Martin added, &ldquo;Specially when it is moving N.N.E.
eighty miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Judge Barton was trying out his Grand Army manner with
Mrs. Maclaughlin, and privately taking stock of place and people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chickens!&rdquo; he said regretfully in response to her
remark that she guessed those chickens would live a day longer in view
of that quarter of beef. &ldquo;Have I contributed, by my own
unselfishness, to my own undoing? The chickens of Manila are not
chickens, they are merely delusions in the form of blood, bones, and
feathers, bought, killed, and served, by a succession of inhuman
Chinese cooks, for the sole purpose of tantalizing the American
stomach. Do I understand that you <i>feed</i> your chickens, and that
they are actually fat?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat as butter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maclaughlin proudly.</p>
<p>The Judge sighed with anticipation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m
going to stay a week,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond of
chicken&mdash;when it <i>is</i> chicken. But tell me, are you never
lonely here, Mrs. Maclaughlin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. Charlotte ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Judge took note of the familiarity, but the laughing eye he
turned upon Mrs. Collingwood did not betray that fact. &ldquo;Yes, we
are talking about you,&rdquo; he said in response to the glance she
gave, hearing her name used. &ldquo;Mrs. Maclaughlin says that you are
never lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am not. I have too many occupations. I am busy
from morning till night. There is no excuse for ennui.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thirst to know what you do. I know a score of ladies who
are suffering from nostalgia with far less excuse for loneliness than
you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is the housekeeping, though our servants are
quite satisfactory, and it isn&rsquo;t onerous; and there is my mending
and Martin&rsquo;s, and my sewing, and I have an hour&rsquo;s school
each day for the children, and an hour&rsquo;s medical inspection,
which usually runs into two or three; and if you will look on our
table, you will not find it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>wholly empty of books and
magazines. Then when Martin comes home, there is tea and talk, and then
dinner. Sometimes after dinner, I read aloud, or Martin and I play a
game of chess. We go to bed early and get up early for we are working
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; said the Judge. &ldquo;I stand confounded. It
is virtue past all the known limits of exemplariness. I wish a few
women of my acquaintance could hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte lifted her brows and smiled with kindly malice.
&ldquo;Your friend Mrs. Badgerly is well?&rdquo; she inquired
sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are no less a mind reader than you formerly were, I
perceive. My friend Mrs. Badgerly is quite well. She was in my thoughts
when I gave utterance to my wish. My friend Mrs. Badgerly is one of
your admirers, Mrs. Collingwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since that memorable day on which you so effectually snubbed
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I did it,&rdquo; Charlotte said emphatically, and
they both laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been done more brutally, I believe,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>the Judge, &ldquo;but never more thoroughly. She
appreciates your powers. She really does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this bit of by-talk the Commissioner and Martin had been paying a
desultory attention as they sipped their tea. At that point, Charlotte
brought the conversation back to something which would include the
other guests, and the Judge got no further opportunity to engross her
attention, till, the dark falling, a servant lit a lamp in the
<i>sala</i>, and Charlotte excused herself on the plea of a
housekeeper&rsquo;s duties. She left the group on the veranda enjoying
the warm starlit darkness, across which the steamer&rsquo;s lights
gleamed cosily. Judge Barton, glancing behind him, saw her
superintending the laying of the table in the living-room of the
cottage, and he abruptly rose and joined her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I help?&rdquo; he said by way of excuse for
presenting himself. &ldquo;I have brought all this nuisance down upon
you. I might be allowed to make myself useful if I can.&rdquo; Then in
reply to her assurance that there was nothing that he could do, and
that she regarded the occasion as a treat and not as a nuisance, he
went on, &ldquo;Then can&rsquo;t I stay and talk to you?&rdquo; He took
the permission for granted and without waiting for a reply, glanced
around the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>room, which, with its quaintly adorned walls,
its tasteful photographs and water-colors, its gleaming brass, and the
glancing lights on carved teak and inlaid blackwood, was full of
charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an absolutely delightful room! and this old table! Where
does Collingwood pick up these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte smilingly laid a finger upon her lips, glancing in the
direction of the Commissioner. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s loot,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know this is,&rdquo; the Judge remarked, standing in
front of the desk. &ldquo;I remember hearing Collingwood say he was in
the Chinese affair in 1900. Why wasn&rsquo;t it my fate to be there
too? It&rsquo;s all very well to talk about our superior civilization,
but there is something in the mere thought of looting treasures like
these to make the mouth water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin did not loot these. Mr. Kingsnorth did. He gave them
to me for a wedding present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky dog! either to loot or to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed to confess,&rdquo; Charlotte admitted, twitching
a tablecloth into better place as a servant laid it, &ldquo;that I am
getting dreadfully mixed upon matters of right and wrong. When I came
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>out here, my principles were simple as day.
There wasn&rsquo;t any doubt how I regarded looters and people who
would accept looted goods. I should as soon have accepted a stolen ham.
And here am I, the possessor of various pieces of looted furniture,
brazenly rejoicing in them, and all the more because they were looted.
I am degenerating hour by hour.&rdquo; She shook her head plaintively
as she put a massive brass candlestick of old Chinese design into its
place.</p>
<p>Judge Barton, leaning against the open casement, his two hands
braced behind on the sill, stood a picture of smiling content as he
studied her. His natural magnetism fairly radiated from him in his
benignant mood. His wealth of grizzling hair, his large-featured,
intellectual face, and one or two lines that bespoke the brute strength
and will of the man, made him look like some roughly but powerfully
sketched figure. His clothes were always fashionably cut and he wore
them well, but the sense of the well formed muscular-body beneath them
always dominated their lines. As he stood beaming upon her, it would
have taken a stronger-minded woman than Mrs. Collingwood to weigh
impartially the balanced charms of the powerful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>intellect and of the powerful animal in the man.
She relaxed her old suspicious guard, which had revived for an instant
when he followed her into the house, so clearly bent upon a
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. Without the faintest suggestion of
sentimental intimacy, they were encased in an atmosphere of congenial
interest. An onlooker would have pronounced them a pair of reunited
chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am dying to say something,&rdquo; said the Judge in
response to her lament over her decaying morals, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know why very well. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m skeered o&rsquo;
you.&rsquo;&rdquo; He threw a fine negro accent into the negro
phrase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it something so impertinent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may so express it, it is humanely impertinent. I know no
other woman to whom I should hesitate to propound it at once, for it is
a question. But I have been scathed by you before this, and I am not
absolutely foolhardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go ahead,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;Impertinence
acknowledged is impertinence disarmed. Besides, I may owe you some
amends. I could never see <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>how I did it, but my husband says
I used to snap your head off every time you spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, you did, indeed.&rdquo; This was said with
fervor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I promise not to snap this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find it more comfortable, then&mdash;being
degenerate, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Mrs. Collingwood stared at him, and he broke into a
peal of laughter in which she presently joined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I must be a formidable person if you were afraid to
ask that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, then, I do. Does my answer
content you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unspeakably. You know we all enjoy being degenerate, but I
never hoped to hear you admit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant, Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s attention was diverted by
the servant, who came back with a tray of cutlery. She indicated
several places at which plates and silver were to be laid, but found
time for an abstracted smile at her guest, who stood waiting her
pleasure while she gave her directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay&mdash;&rdquo; she returned briskly to the subject
after this lapse of time&mdash;&ldquo;I was very priggish. Martin has
humanized me&mdash;there is no doubt of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>it&mdash;and I am
grateful to him. He is so humorously practical. How do you think he is
looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;fine!&rdquo; Judge Barton was conscious of a
restiveness suppressed. He said to himself that he had not come two
hundred and fifty miles to talk about Martin Collingwood&rsquo;s
looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you think so, because I think so myself. I fancy
Mrs. Maclaughlin did not feed him properly in the old days, and men get
so careless by themselves. He says I &lsquo;hold him up to the collar
beautifully&rsquo; and I really try to, and regular food and physical
comfort will tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collingwood is the picture of health and of masculine good
looks,&rdquo; said Judge Barton; &ldquo;and as for you, it is a joy to
see anyone looking so healthy, so vital. You have changed immensely. I
wonder, dear lady, if you yourself realized how tired and nearly
broken-down you were in those old days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was miserable, physically and nervously worn out, and I
suppose I looked it. But I have had a glorious rest and nothing in the
world to fret or worry about, and&mdash;&rdquo; she raised her eyes to
his, blushing as she approached the topic which had been the source of
so much constraint between them&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>&ldquo;and Martin and
I have been ridiculously happy in each other. I may as well be frank
and admit that half that was depressing me was sheer loneliness and
wounded pride. Probably the loneliness was much my own fault, for I
hardly met people half way; and the wounded pride was wholly my own
fault, for I started out to earn my own living in defiance of all my
relatives&rsquo; wishes. I suppose I had not the philosophy to meet the
situation, in spite of that hateful little slap you gave me about
&lsquo;the unloveliest thing in women.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Judge started
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for giving me my opportunity,&rdquo; he said in a
low voice. &ldquo;I could not have referred to it otherwise. I have
writhed with shame every time I have thought of those words, Mrs.
Collingwood. Will you permit me to apologize for them and for numerous
other unmanly stabs that I have given you? I do not know why I did it;
all the time I was longing to be friends with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I irritated you,&rdquo; Charlotte replied slowly, a
little surprised by his vehemence. &ldquo;It is inexplicable to me also
when I look back upon it. I had really forgiven you long ago. You were
very nice to us on our wedding day, I remember, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>and
I felt forlorn and deserted enough on that occasion to be grateful to
anyone who showed any signs of human interest in us. But I am glad that
you have apologized, and am glad to express my forgiveness, and to
regret that I was so snappish. All of which may be expressed in that
homely phrase, &lsquo;Let us bury the hatchet.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were always meant to be friends, I think.&rdquo; Some
vibration in the voice made Charlotte sheer off from an approach to
intensity. &ldquo;Martin always liked you,&rdquo; she said; and thus,
ten seconds after their reconciliation, the Judge had cause to reflect
with some irritation that there is no woman in the world so
unsatisfying at times as one born without natural coquetry. He had a
few minutes in which to develop this idea, while Charlotte made a
voyage of investigation to the kitchen. She came back well satisfied.
&ldquo;I think we can count on dinner in half an hour,&rdquo; she said,
and carried him back with her to the veranda, where she did her duty by
the Commissioner and the Honorable Mr. Jones, who was not expansive on
any subject other than oyster shells.</p>
<p>Kingsnorth, who had gone over to his own cottage and had donned the
English mess jacket, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>is the standard evening attire in
the Orient, came back, an undeniable English gentleman in spite of his
degenerate countenance, and devoted himself to the <span class="corr"
id="xd20e1989" title="Source: judical">judicial</span> luminary, who
took stock of him as they chatted. Indeed, the Judge was profoundly
interested in Charlotte&rsquo;s island companions. The Maclaughlins
were the sort of people he would expect to find in company with
Collingwood, but the Englishman was a surprise. He said to himself that
it must have strained all Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s pride to accommodate
herself to that household, and he marvelled at her tremendous growth in
self-control and in social vagabondage. Six months before she would not
have met so unconcernedly such a situation as that in which she found
herself.</p>
<p>At dinner the Commissioner, sitting on one side of Mrs. Collingwood
with the Judge on the other, was secretly amazed at the house, the
household, and the very agreeable woman who was his hostess. With one
laughing remark&mdash;&ldquo;My dear, I am the housekeeper, and I
won&rsquo;t be apologized for&rdquo;&mdash;she had silenced Martin, who
was inclined to drift into that apologetic and explanatory vein which
demands continual reassurance from the guests of their appreciation of
their food; and, picking up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>the conversational ball, she had
sent it spinning lightly here and there through all the courses of as
perfectly served a dinner as the Commissioner had ever sat through. She
was ably assisted by the two officials and Kingsnorth and even by
Martin, whose delight in his wife&rsquo;s grasp of the situation set
his dry, keen wits at bubbling effervescence. Maclaughlin, though not
partial to what he called &ldquo;gentlefolk,&rdquo; was a hard-headed
Scot, not likely to rush in where angels tread lightly, and Mrs.
Maclaughlin, who found the general trend of conversation too agile for
her, may be said to have concentrated herself on the oyster-shell
seeker and the Captain, who suffered also from a slowness of abstract
speech.</p>
<p>It was also, considering the fact that it was limited by the
resources of a comparatively unproductive island, a good dinner, even
in the opinion of two habitual diners-out. It began with a cocktail of
Martin&rsquo;s own mixing and was continued in a clear soup and in a
baked fish which must have weighed ten pounds and was of incomparable
flavor. &ldquo;Never have I eaten such fish,&rdquo; declared Judge
Barton, helping himself the second time to the fish and its garnish of
thin, sliced cucumbers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href=
"#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>Then there was a roast of beef
highly relished by the fisher folk, <i>camote</i>, or sweet potato,
croquettes, a dish of bamboo sprouts cooked after a savory native
recipe, and green peppers stuffed with force-meat. There was a crab
salad, deliciously cold, and papaya ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you obtain ice?&rdquo; said the Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a small machine which freezes one hundred pounds
daily,&rdquo; replied Charlotte, &ldquo;just enough for each cottage
and the mess kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember when Collingwood proposed having that machine made
by special order, how I pooh-poohed the idea,&rdquo; remarked
Kingsnorth. &ldquo;I was not sufficiently Americanized to feel the need
of it. But I am as bad as the rest of them now. Frozen desserts are the
only ones fit for the tropics; and I&rsquo;ve even learned to drink
iced-tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general chorus of assent went up. &ldquo;You certainly make
yourselves comfortable,&rdquo; the Commissioner declared, &ldquo;and,
really, failing a fresh beef supply, you seem to have all that we get
in Manila, in addition to a more charming situation. I suppose your
only real difficulty is the matter of medical aid.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That is our only real <i>fear</i>,&rdquo; Collingwood
replied. &ldquo;We keep a supply of coal on hand for emergencies, and
we never let it get below a certain point. We keep a reserve sufficient
to take the launch over to Cuyo or to Romblon. But if there came a
sudden need in bad weather, we should be in the deuce of a fix. It is
the only thought that ever keeps me awake at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commissioner nodded and murmured something appreciative of a
possible crisis. Certainly this very entertaining lady who sat beside
him&mdash;a lady who had seen something of the world if he was any
judge of personality&mdash;must feel herself strangely situated in that
out of the way spot, chancing the dangers of tidal waves, of storms,
and of illness without medical assistance. He fancied the situation was
explicable. The compromises which women make for matrimony had offered
him food for reflection long before he ever saw Mrs. Collingwood; but
what he could not understand was why she should have been among those
who have to make compromises. A woman of her grace and finish ought to
have a pretty wide field of selection, he thought; but then one can
never tell how circumstances <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href=
"#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>force persons into unfortunate
positions. The Englishman was a dose; not that he had altogether lost
his breeding, but that the atmosphere of degeneration hung so palpably
about him. &ldquo;How he must hate himself,&rdquo; thought the
Commissioner, &ldquo;to make us all so conscious of his fall!&rdquo; He
removed his eyes from Kingsnorth&rsquo;s face after arriving at this
conclusion, just in time to meet the clear gaze of his hostess, and to
know, by her sudden blush and momentary shrinking, that she had read
him like an open book, and to realize that she was self-conscious of
her own situation.</p>
<p>She was enough mistress of herself, however, to hold the
conversation at its level. She asked with intelligent interest about
those political events in the islands, concerning which it is tactful
to question Commissioners. She drew the statesman out on the subject of
his own hopes and plans for the islands. He in turn asked information
from the fishers, and they, warming to the theme as men will when they
talk of things in which they are experienced, gave him their practical,
hard-headed views of men and conditions, spoke of native labor and its
capacities and incapacities, of resources and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>possibilities, and of the disadvantages of
political unrest to a people more primitive than any that ever before
held the reins of government.</p>
<p>Even an illiterate man is interesting when he talks of his craft,
and Martin Collingwood, however little natural development he had in
social subtilties, was anything but illiterate or even ill informed. To
his wife he seemed to gather new dignity as he took a leader&rsquo;s
natural position. It was plain that his business associates deferred to
him; and in ten minutes it was plain that the Commissioner knew he was
dealing with a man who would, in the financial world at least, make
himself felt. Commissioners never ignore financiers. There came into
the Commissioner&rsquo;s manner as the dinner progressed, something
more deferential than the mere civility of a guest to a host, something
which implied his acceptance of Mr. Collingwood as a man to be
considered.</p>
<p>It was, on the whole, a most successful dinner. The newcomers had
brought with them a current of the outer atmosphere, breathing interest
and exhilaration into the little colony of self-exiles; and the exiles
shared themselves so wholly with the outsiders that the outsiders grew
to feel much at home. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>When, at eleven o&rsquo;clock,
they all walked down to the beach with the Commissioner and the
Captain, regrets and good-byes were as hearty as they would have been
if the acquaintance had been of long duration.</p>
<p>As he was pulled out to the steamer, the Commissioner remembered
that, on the way down, Barton had given him a hint of an odd situation,
to which he had paid but a cursory attention. Well it was for the old
gossip that he was safe ashore under the tent. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
have it out of him going back,&rdquo; reflected the Commissioner.
&ldquo;Fine woman! Fine manly fellow, her husband; sort of man we need
out here! He isn&rsquo;t her equal socially, but I suppose women forget
social differences just as we do when they come under the attraction of
good looks and manly traits. Besides, if he makes money, she can float
him with no difficulty. A <span class="corr" id="xd20e2034" title=
"Source: remark-a-bly">remarkably</span> fine woman.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Judge Barton&rsquo;s servant, aided by
Kingsnorth&rsquo;s boy and Martin&rsquo;s, had put up the tents and had
seen thoroughly to the comfort of the visitors, so that there was
nothing more to do than to bid the guests good night and to warn them
of the island habit of sea bathing every morning. Jones had no bathing
suit, but Kingsnorth said he would be able to lend him one; while Judge
Barton, showing his fine white teeth in an appreciative smile, remarked
that he never travelled without one. &ldquo;We shall see you in the
morning, then,&rdquo; said Charlotte, and she and Martin betook
themselves to their own dwelling. Martin sank lazily into his hammock
on the veranda for a final cigar, while Charlotte went to give some
orders to her cook about breakfast. She found that gentleman asleep on
the kitchen table with his head on a bread board. Rudely awakened and
asked for explanations, he stated that he had not gone to his quarters,
because the Se&ntilde;ora had sent him word that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>she
wished to speak with him; but finding the time pass slowly, he had
fallen asleep as she had found him. He asked her plaintively why she
had been so impatient with him for so small an offence, and he held out
the bread board to show that it had suffered no harm. &ldquo;Wash it
with boiling water! Why not? but ma&ntilde;ana, ma&ntilde;ana! As she
could plainly see there was no boiling water at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The situation being one in which racial intelligence beats itself
helplessly against racial unintelligence, Charlotte contented herself
with a note in her housekeeping tablets to remind her to superintend
the washing process the next morning, gave her orders, and returned to
her room. Martin was standing before her glass in his shirt and
trousers, a costume which always seemed to add to his stature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will you believe me?&rdquo; he began teasingly.
&ldquo;What did I tell you about the Judge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a word to say, but I was surprised. What do
you suppose brought him down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you he wanted to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he wanted to see us, and we will treat him on that
basis. That means that you must do your share of the entertaining. I do
not want him on my hands all the time. He may just as well <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>go
with you each day as stay around the house. Promise me, dear, that you
will take him on your shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an unmistakable earnestness about Charlotte&rsquo;s
manner. She was pulling hairpins out of her hair as she spoke, and she
laid those feminine accessories somewhat vigorously in a mother of
pearl box, which Martin, to honor his calling, had insisted on having
made for her. Her husband sank suddenly into a rocking chair and pulled
her down on his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the funniest woman I ever knew,&rdquo; he said
reflectively, &ldquo;the first one I ever knew who wouldn&rsquo;t play
on a man&rsquo;s jealousy. The truth is I was just half inclined to be
jealous, but you&rsquo;ve disarmed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t conceive myself, Martin, playing on your
jealousy. The whole idea is abhorrent to me. Jealousy implies distrust.
Do you think me capable of a flirtation with Judge Barton? Do you think
I should enjoy making you distrust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s face was a study. &ldquo;You might not mean anything
but a little fun,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;Most women
begin that way. And then you might find that you liked him best. That
happens. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>It happens often. And the Judge is a big
somebody, and I am a pearl-fisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone grew bitter as he pronounced the last words. It was almost
the first time that Charlotte had heard him refer to the worldly
distinctions that he affected to despise. But if he had expected his
self-disparagement to bring him a reward in a counter disparagement of
the Judge, he was disappointed. Charlotte sat on his knee, a very
earnest figure, her teeth nipping her lower lip, her brows frowning
with a very real perplexity. Her manner brought back to him his old
fear of her unexpectedness in thought and action. But even as he sat
wondering, she turned and smiled, and he drew a long breath of
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well have this out now,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Perhaps I am making a mistake in revealing myself to you
frankly. I think men understand the other sort of woman better, the one
who plays upon their jealousy. I believe they value her higher.&rdquo;
She closed his protesting lips with a gentle finger. &ldquo;I am afraid
that I do not belong wholly to the twentieth century, Martin. They call
it the age of individualism. But I believe yet in those old tenets
which were not individual opinions, but the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>joint consensus of generations seeking a livable
basis for men and women. I believe in marriage and the family, and a
lot of old-fashioned things. I believe that what chastity is to a
woman, physical courage is to a man. I believe that women are born into
this world to bear children and that men are born to fight for woman
and child. The men of the present day seem to entertain a dream of
universal peace, so perhaps the women are excusable for entertaining a
dream of universal barrenness. However, that&rsquo;s irrelevant. We can
discuss that another time. But when I took you for my husband, Martin,
believing in all these old-fashioned ideas, I did it in the
consciousness that the choice was final, the determining factor of my
life. So long as you live, there is between me and every other man in
the world a barrier (I know not what it is) across which my mind will
never step, and across which no man will ever try to address me twice.
No, I won&rsquo;t be kissed&mdash;it is the first time I have ever
repelled a caress from you, but to me this moment is too serious for
caresses. You have the man&rsquo;s right to resent another man&rsquo;s
possessive thought of me; but you have no right to be jealous of me. I
do not say that I will always love you. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>There are offences
which you could commit against me which would turn my love to hatred. I
do not pose as the angelic, forgiving woman. I give fidelity. I demand
it in return. If you ever cease to love me, somehow, if it breaks my
heart, I shall cease to love you. I would not submit to personal
brutality from you or from any living being. But so long as you live
there will be, in a sentimental sense, but one man in the world for me.
I want you to know that, to understand it and feel it in every fibre of
your being, even though I know you hold me cheaper for so understanding
it.&rdquo; Her bosom heaved, her cheeks were fiery, and she would have
sprung from his knee only that he held her in a clasp that was iron.
His own eyes flashed a reply to hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no cause to say that last,&rdquo; he said hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No cause, when ten minutes ago, you assured me of my
unlikeness to other women! Look into your heart of hearts and ask
yourself if I am a dearer possession now that you know that, come good
or ill, with you or apart from you, in love or in anger, I hold myself
yours and no other man&rsquo;s. And I do so not out of any false
loyalty to you, for there are conditions which might cancel your
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>right to ask loyalty. No: it is loyalty to
myself. And this much I know of the whole male sex; that while you are
infinitely content to know that there are women who can entertain such
ideals and hold to them at any sacrifice, you hold the individual woman
cheaper for the knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him accusingly, and at first, half confounded, half
amused with her unusual intensity, he tried to stare back; but in the
end, his eyes fell and a dull shame burned in his cheek. For he knew
that what she said was true, and that in the very moment of her
assurances, he felt the loss of something to guard, felt that
easy-going surety which a man of his experiences with women knows only
too well how to diagnose. However, another emotion of a very great
pride in her capacity and in her frankness and a sense of guilt made
him very abject. He held her when she tried again to slip from his
arms; and when, to his consternation, she put her head down on his
shoulder and her body was shaken with noiseless sobs, he was as
comforting as she could have desired him to be, and she felt a
repentant tear mingle with her own.</p>
<p>She allowed herself no luxury of grief, and after a few convulsive
efforts got control of herself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211"
href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>But she lay with her head on
his shoulder for a long time, and when she spoke it was with a mournful
dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had our tragic moment,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I
with my wretched love of staring facts in the face have unearthed a
family skeleton. Let&rsquo;s put it back in the cupboard, Martin. Yours
was a bogey skeleton, and I was so anxious to show it up for a fraud,
that I dragged out the genuine one. That&rsquo;s singularly in keeping
with my lifelong habit. Don&rsquo;t look so long-faced, Martin. Are you
angry?&rdquo; She put her face caressingly against his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry! Why should I be angry? I wish you didn&rsquo;t analyze
things so minutely, Lottie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I didn&rsquo;t too, Martin, but I can&rsquo;t help it.
That&rsquo;s my punishment for being I. Oh, how I wish I were not
I!&rdquo; She looked at him with eyes unfathomably tired and sad, eyes
of that gentle appeal that went straight to the depths of his masculine
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I love you as you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t measure how much more or less for being sure of
you&mdash;but I&rsquo;m mighty glad to be sure of you&mdash;and I
can&rsquo;t take my own insides to pieces as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>you
can, but all the same I love you, love you, Lottie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as he smoked a last cigar,&mdash;for he said that their talk had
driven sleep from him&mdash;Mr. Collingwood uttered but one phrase as
he monotonously paced back and forth across his veranda. Sometimes he
uttered it with irritation, sometimes he mouthed it slowly as if its
terse brevity were the outlet of profound conviction. Sometimes he even
smiled tenderly over it, as a memory of his wife&rsquo;s earnestness
brushed across his vision. But however he said it, he repeated it again
and again; and it was, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; For
the lady he had married had again said and done the unexpected
thing.</p>
<p>Charlotte was still less inclined to sleep than her lord, though she
went through the semblance of courting slumber. She was infinitely
annoyed with herself for her own outburst, and was seeking what seemed
a reasonable cause for so much emotion, but could not find one. She
heartily wished Judge Barton had seen fit to wait for an invitation
before he invaded Maylubi; and, though she declined to admit that she
looked upon his coming as an omen, she was inclined to feel that he had
been altogether <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213"
name="pb213">213</a>]</span>too mixed in her romance. He had been an
unsympathetic and amused onlooker at her courtship; he had been with
them on that last crucial evening before their marriage;&mdash;she
wondered how much his mere presence had influenced her in her
subsequent speech with Martin;&mdash;he had been present at the
wedding; and now his coming was contemporaneous with their nearest
approach to a quarrel. As for what she had eased her mind of to Martin,
she knew that she was right, but she added, self-accusingly, that her
knowing it was all wrong. Quite mournfully she arraigned herself, and
she assented whole-heartedly in what she knew must be Martin&rsquo;s
secret verdict&mdash;that women have no business with ideas of a
philosophy on sex matters: that they should be limited to instincts and
to principles. Long after Martin had ceased to pass upon his own
condemnation, and was sleeping like an exaggerated infant, she lay
wide-eyed, fearing she knew not what, but conscious of change
impending. She had had eight months of a happiness more nearly perfect
than she had ever dreamed could be hers, and it was not in the nature
of things temporal as she knew them that such happiness could be of
long duration. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>Judge Barton meanwhile had retired to his tent, but had him drawn
thence by a late-rising moon and his own cogitations. As he paced
slowly up and down the silvery beach, his thoughts rushed one after
another in confusing circles. First of all he anathematized himself for
daring to put to the test that lulled security of his own feelings for
Mrs. Collingwood. He had left her on her wedding day, himself a prey to
a charm that had struck him, as it were, between the eyes, struck him
with that force which emotion can attain only when it is suddenly
aroused for one who has played an unheeded part in the subject&rsquo;s
life up to the moment of its birth. It had been months since he deemed
that his sudden obsession for Mrs. Collingwood was dead, killed by very
weariness of itself, and by continual thwarting. For a week or ten days
after his parting with her, he had gone about with her face constantly
before him, with her voice in his ears. He had started at the sight of
a figure in the distance, resembling hers. His appetite had failed him,
zest in all things had departed from him. The congratulations of his
confr&egrave;res on a brilliant decision had, it seemed to him, been
mockery. He wanted her approval, nobody else&rsquo;s. The women
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>of his acquaintance bored him to irritation.
&ldquo;I am in love,&rdquo; he admitted to himself, &ldquo;in love with
a married woman whom I probably might have married myself had I so
desired. I saw her every day for six weeks, and far from entertaining
any sentimental thoughts about her, I deliberately set myself to tease
and annoy her. I lost all sight of her for six weeks, and in that time
never gave her a thought; but when I found her with her lover at her
side and saw her vow herself to him, for reasons only known to the imp
of perversity I discovered that she was my long lost affinity. My God!
was ever man before such an imbecile? How can a man conceive such an
affection for a woman who has given him one tremulous smile on her
wedding day? What does this thing feed on? Am I coming to my
dotage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In such strain did the Judge berate himself through ten or twelve
weary days, and then the obsession left him as suddenly as it had come.
Interest and ambition returned, he found his women friends as
entertaining as ever, and though he thought often and kindly of Mrs.
Collingwood, his meditations were tinged with a strain of that violet
usually allotted to the dead. Past experience had taught <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>him
that sentimental fancies about women, once chilled, are hard to
resuscitate, and he felt quite certain that Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s
ghost would trouble his musings no more. He fell into the habit of
thinking about the experience humorously, he spoke of it to himself as
&ldquo;my tragedy,&rdquo; and once he nearly allowed a clever woman to
worm the story out of him. The accidental intrusion of a third person
was all that saved him from an access of garrulity; but having been
saved, he was able to contemplate with retrospective horror his
nearness to the brink and to avoid all subsequent promenadings on that
path.</p>
<p>When by mere chance, he found himself invited to accompany the
Commissioner and the oyster-shell agent on their voyage of discovery,
he accepted the invitation with delight, regarding himself as a man
protected by inoculation. He owned up, however, to a frank curiosity
about the Collingwoods, and to a strong desire to see them together in
their home; but he had as little expectation of a revival of his fancy
for Mrs. Collingwood as he had of beholding so great a change in the
lady herself.</p>
<p>But it had revived! It was there in full force, bringing with it the
primitive man&rsquo;s sense that desire <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>is right. From the
moment he had again beheld Charlotte&rsquo;s high-bred face with her
soul shining through the gray eyes, and had been again conscious of her
fastidiousness and of her intelligence,&mdash;in short, of all the
overpowering emanations of a unique personality,&mdash;his old passion
to dominate her, to hold her fascinated by his own powerful magnetism,
burned like a fever within him. It burned the more that in the lapsed
months some new element of charm had come to her, as if the enlarging
of human experience had fused and melted into softer lines those sturdy
elements of character which had repelled quite as often as they had
attracted him. She was not to be flirted with&mdash;that he knew only
too well, and he had to put on eyes and voice a guard that cost him
dear; but he could not resist following her when she went to supervise
her dinner preparations, he could not resist the grudging sense he had
of every word addressed to another than himself.</p>
<p>He cursed his folly in submitting himself to temptation. By his own
act he had put himself in this place and had burned his bridges behind
him. He had let himself in for a week of the society of a woman, to
associate with whom, on the terms on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>which he must meet
her, was sheer tantalization. She would not flirt with him, nor was she
of the ingenuously simple sort which can be flirted with without
knowing the fact. The Judge smiled ruefully as he tried to imagine
Charlotte Collingwood dominated by any emotion which she could not
analyze. Plainly, he had one course before him&mdash;to see as little
as possible of Mrs. Collingwood except in her husband&rsquo;s presence,
and to guard his eyes and tongue if by chance he should find himself
alone with her. He was rather proud of his virtuous resolutions, but he
dreaded the slow-going days&mdash;seven of them before the steamer
would return and he could put time and distance between him and
Charlotte Collingwood. The Judge had great faith in Time as a mender of
all things. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=

<p class="first">The next morning at the matutinal swim the Judge
affixed himself as a satellite to Kingsnorth, and left the married pair
to take their morning recreation together. At breakfast, he talked
business and accepted with apparent eagerness an invitation to visit
the fishing grounds with the workers and the shell-purveyor. He went on
that day and on five other days, enduring a great many sights and
smells that he by no means enjoyed, but admitting to himself that
anything was better than battling with the continual temptation to
bombard Mrs. Collingwood with the declaration of his passion for her.
He had enough to do to watch his betraying eye and voice during those
long hours, from five o&rsquo;clock till bedtime, during which the
little colony was perforce united; and at the end of each day&rsquo;s
dragging torment, he balanced a mental account in which he itemized on
one side his self-restraint, its pains and penances, and on the other
Charlotte&rsquo;s gradual revelation of all her hidden <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>loveableness. At first, a shadow of her old
guard had hung about her, and she had been reserved; but reassured by
his frank geniality and his apparent desire to see as much of
Collingwood as possible, she gradually relaxed her watchfulness, and
admitted him to the place of a tried family friend.</p>
<p>One warm night, when the Maclaughlins, Kingsnorth, and the
oyster-agent had given themselves up to the delights of bridge, the
other three strolled along the beach till they came to an old banca
lying bottom up on the sand. There was no moon, but the stars burned
steadily overhead, their reflections rising and falling with each slow
wave. A ghostly thread of white fire outlined each breaker that toppled
lazily over, and the gentle succession of splashes was like a deep
harmonic accompaniment to the shrill chorus of insect life which burst
from the grove behind them. They sat and listened a long while, each
under the same charm, which was a different charm. It was Charlotte who
first broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of the noise, isn&rsquo;t it still, isn&rsquo;t it
lonely, isn&rsquo;t it delightful?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is like a
sort of Truce of God thrown into our lives of struggle and
overstrain.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can never accustom myself to those sentiments from you,
Mrs. Collingwood,&rdquo; said the Judge. &ldquo;To me you seem a woman
so eminently fitted to be a part of the great world, that I cannot
understand your getting along so well without it. It is like seeing a
musician trying to live without music, or an artist without pencils and
brushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte swam out into the big world and got a mouthful of
salt water, and it made her sick,&rdquo; Martin put it. He fancied the
Judge&rsquo;s words had reference to living in a city among hordes of
fellow beings. Of society as a fine art, Martin had no conception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite true, Martin; but it isn&rsquo;t my only
reason for liking our present life. Your &lsquo;great world,&rsquo;
Judge Barton, means a continual drain upon one&rsquo;s tact and
patience, a continual smoothing over of difficulties, of forcing
oneself to adapt oneself to people with whom one has no real sympathy.
This life is a sort of moral drifting, with the consciousness that the
current moves in the right direction. The other world is full of
experiences. One passes from one perception to another, one&rsquo;s
being is wrung with the continual play of warring emotions; but here
one sits down quietly to digest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222"
href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>and to let one&rsquo;s soul
feed on the food one has gathered in that plethora of
emotions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you know how aptly you illustrate your
theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have grown,&rdquo; she declared tranquilly.
&ldquo;It seems to me my horizon has broadened infinitely while I have
been here. When I was a child living in a convent, we internes were
given annually a week at the seashore. Our unfailing recreation was to
run about with a tin pail and a spade, filling the pail with
sea-shells, seaweed, and all the other seashore treasures which
children delight in. And when we went home, I remember the joy I had in
going through my pail. Things flopped in so rapidly during the day that
I hardly knew what was there. But the ecstasy of the twilight hour when
I sorted my treasures! My life here has been something like that tin
pail sorting-out. I have sat down to review impressions, to throw away
the valueless, to classify and arrange the rest. It has been a
priceless experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good; but you don&rsquo;t want to keep it up
forever,&rdquo; remarked Collingwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy Mrs. Collingwood will begin constructing after she
has finished sorting.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=
"#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A philosophy! Remember you warned me against it. Besides I
have my doubts of a philosophy&rsquo;s ever being satisfactory to a
woman. For myself I have no hopes of ever being more than consistently
inconsistent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your demands are modest.&rdquo; This in rather an inscrutable
voice from the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so? Have you not learned that really
modest demands on life are like elegantly simple clothing, the most
expensive to be obtained? Get my husband to tell you his demands on
life, and you will hear something that really is modest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with it, Collingwood. I have never given you credit for
modest demands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collingwood puffed out two rings of smoke, and removed his cigar. He
was sitting at his wife&rsquo;s feet as she sat on the banca, and he
leaned his head back luxuriously against her knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above five millions as near as I can make it is my figure. I
might do with more if I could get it, but I don&rsquo;t see where I can
do with less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you call that modest!&rdquo; said Judge Barton ironically
to Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call any demand on life modest which can be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>expressed in dollars and cents. But
Martin&rsquo;s only modest demand is for the five millions. He has
others not so modest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name one,&rdquo; challenged Collingwood, sitting up in some
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do nothing of the kind. Find them out for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about me?&rdquo; There was a tone almost of abject
anxiety in Judge Barton&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you! You know that you draw sight drafts on the universe
daily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which are seldom honored,&rdquo; the Judge remarked somewhat
bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all getting blamed mysterious to me,&rdquo;
interrupted Collingwood. &ldquo;I wish you two would talk down to my
level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk up to it, you mean,&rdquo; replied Charlotte
good-naturedly. &ldquo;For you cannot believe for an instant that the
irresponsible demands of two persons asking for the impossible are to
be put on a higher level than a practical demand like yours that can be
expressed in figures, even if it runs into seven. You ask nothing of
life, Martin, that isn&rsquo;t in it; while those drafts of Judge
Barton, as well as my own, are drawn on an ideal universe. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>Judge and I are not content with things as they
are. We do not own up often, but this seems a propitious moment. Deep
in his heart each of us is echoing that old refrain of
Omar&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ah Love! could you and I with Him conspire</p>
<p class="line">To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,</p>
<p class="line">Would not we shatter it to bits&mdash;and then</p>
<p class="line">Remould it nearer to the Heart&rsquo;s
Desire!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty. Say that again,&rdquo;
said Martin; and she repeated it. At its end he said wistfully,
&ldquo;I thought you and I had our hearts&rsquo; desires.&rdquo; And
Judge Barton broke into his short, ironical laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me my husband can&rsquo;t make pretty
speeches,&rdquo; said Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He clings to his commercial instincts,&rdquo; said the Judge,
&ldquo;for he asked as much as he gave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Martin. &ldquo;I am beginning to be
proud of myself. I didn&rsquo;t know I gave or asked. I thought I
referred to things that are understood. You <i>are</i> my heart&rsquo;s
desire. All the rest is just working, and being glad when I succeed,
and angry when I fail. It&rsquo;s taking hard knocks and gritting my
teeth over them, and saying to myself that I&rsquo;ll blast what I want
out of this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>universe yet. That&rsquo;s just living. But I
don&rsquo;t want the world made over. It suits me all right, and I
thought it suited you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge Barton&rsquo;s gaze was fixed on the vague moving mass of
waters before them, but Charlotte fancied she could detect a tense
interest in her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not suit me altogether,&rdquo; she replied slowly,
&ldquo;but if Judge Barton will forgive an exchange of conjugal
compliments, I&rsquo;ll admit that it has come very near suiting me,
since I married you. My little burst of this evening is an echo of a
former self. It&rsquo;s the sort of thing I have said so much in my
life, that it ripples off my tongue through force of habit whenever
anyone strikes a harmonious note. And now I am going in. I am tired and
sleepy, and I know that you both want to talk business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Judge rose as she did. Martin remained on the upturned banca.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you before long,&rdquo; he said, and before
she was out of earshot she heard him say, &ldquo;What do you think the
administration is likely to do?&rdquo; The rest trailed off in an
indistinct murmur; but she smiled, knowing that Philippine policy was
uppermost. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next morning Judge Barton found his self-denying spirit in the
minority, and a very insistent small voice demanding a reward for five
days of self-immolation. Secure in the knowledge of his past
will-power, and confident that the next day would see him off the
island, he asked himself why there was any need of sacrificing himself
to the heat and smells of another day on the launch. He pleaded a
headache, ate little to bear evidence to his sincerity, and after
breakfast retired to his tent with the honest intention of keeping it
till noon at least for very consistency&rsquo;s sake. Through its open
sides, he could view Mrs. Collingwood at her daily routine.</p>
<p>She came out upon the broad veranda, made a minute examination of
the flower-pots, pulled a few dead fronds from a great air-fern which
hung in one of the windows, and cut a nosegay from the hedge of golden
cannas. Afterwards he saw her through the open casement, sitting at her
desk, and apparently making entries in an account book. At nine
o&rsquo;clock, six or eight children between the ages of seven and
fourteen arrived and squatted down on the veranda. Charlotte came out
with an armful of books, which she distributed; and with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>help of one of the larger boys, she also brought
out an easel on which was a rude blackboard.</p>
<p>At this point the Judge&rsquo;s resolution weakened. He donned a
coat and ambled over to the veranda. To his hostess&rsquo;s somewhat
suspicious, &ldquo;Better so soon?&rdquo; he returned an honest
confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just one of my boyhood headaches,&rdquo; he admitted,
&ldquo;the kind that used to keep me in bed till nine o&rsquo;clock,
when school had taken up. Did you never have that sort of headache,
Mrs. Collingwood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. I was a conscientious child, though I am willing to
admit that it was doubtless a great mistake to be so. Rufino,
begin.&rdquo; And Rufino began chantingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;E see a cuf. A ball is in de cuf. Srow de ball to me.&rdquo;
He paused triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> see a cup,&rdquo; corrected Charlotte. &ldquo;Say it
after me&mdash;cup, <i>cup</i>&rdquo; and she pronounced the final
consonant so distinctly that Rufino proceeded without
difficulty:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a cuppa. A ball is in de cuppa. Srow de ball to
me.&rdquo; There was no little difficulty in inducing Rufino to say
<i>throw</i>, and he did not succeed until Mrs. Collingwood made him
take his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>tongue in his two fingers and pull it through
his teeth, preliminary to attacking the word. His mates took exuberant
joy in this feat, and the next boy, Wenceslao de los Angeles, started
out glibly: &ldquo;I see a cuppa. A ball is in de cuppa,&rdquo; and
then dropped his book, gave his tongue a convulsive jerk and
spluttered, &ldquo;Srow de cuppa to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Judge gurgled as helplessly as the children did, blushed, tried
to save the situation, and looked exceedingly severe. Mrs. Collingwood,
a little flushed, threw him a protesting glance, smiled, bit her lip
and went on with the reading lesson. When every aspirant had had a
chance to see the cup and to pull his tongue, she proceeded to
&ldquo;develop&rdquo; the lesson. The Judge was bored. It was one of
the miseries of his strange infatuation for her that merely being with
her or able to watch her afforded him no satisfaction. He wanted to
monopolize her, to keep her attention constantly centred in himself. If
this feeling was Nature, working in its own blind way to accomplish
what the man&rsquo;s intellect told him could not be done, the Judge
ruefully reflected that Nature can sometimes keep a man very miserable,
and that she wastes a great deal of human effort. For whether her
thoughts were with him or away <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>from him, he was secretly
conscious of what she had told her husband, that there was for her, in
one sense, but one man in the world. Her old suspicion of him was
lulled, and she stood ready for fair honest friendship; but there never
had been, in one glance of her eye, in her occasional merry laugh, or
in her frank converse, the faintest evidence of that sex consciousness
which is in no wise to be confounded with social self-consciousness,
but which, as an element in woman&rsquo;s entity, is the only possible
excuse for the banalities which men are usually eager to exchange with
them by the hour.</p>
<p>The Judge was wearily awaiting the close of the reading lesson when
he received another disappointment in the sight of numerous physically
incommoded individuals who strolled up by detachments, and squatted at
the foot of the veranda steps. There was a consumptive in a
<i>talebon</i>, or hammock, in which the sick are carried about. There
was a small boy with a boil on his kneecap. He had plastered it with
lime, a disinfectant for almost all skin troubles in the Philippines;
and he <i>alternately</i> felt it gingerly, and glanced apprehensively,
if fascinatedly, in the direction of the &ldquo;medequilla.&rdquo;
There were ulcers, and yellow jaundiced folk suffering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>with
a seasonal fever. The Judge decided that fully one-fifth of the
island&rsquo;s population was represented in the assemblage, and he
gave a shrug of commiseration as he reflected how they must have
suffered unaided before the coming of Charlotte.</p>
<p>He was watching her somewhat closely as she struggled with the
limited understanding of one of her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i>,
when she glanced down the beach, and he saw a great tide of crimson
rush to her cool, clear skin. Naturally his eyes followed hers, but he
saw approaching only a rather young and comely girl carrying a young
child in her arms. He had barely time to perceive this when Mrs.
Collingwood turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to dismiss my class and take these poor people
next, and I can&rsquo;t let you assist at that. I am dreadfully
self-conscious about it with any on-lookers. There isn&rsquo;t any
evading the fact that it is really daring on my part to attempt to play
physician, and nurse, too; but something has to be done for them. But I
really couldn&rsquo;t bear an audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; said the Judge with a laugh. He did
not, however, turn toward his tent, which would have taken him away
from the approaching girl, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=
"#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>but swung briskly down the sand in
the direction from which she was advancing.</p>
<p>She greeted him with the customary civility of Filipinos, and he
vouchsafed her a nod. He dared not stop and speak to her, but he made
directly for the native village, a mile away, where he asked the
headman who she was. When he had extracted the full details of the
story, he turned and strolled slowly back. But he did not rejoin Mrs.
Collingwood. He went, instead, to his tent, where he sat gazing
meditatively across the sea while he turned over and over the facts
that he had heard.</p>
<p>She had compromised with life with a vengeance! He felt that she had
gone far when he beheld the Maclaughlins and Kingsnorth. But to live
openly in daily converse with such a man, to sit at the table with him,
and to minister to the needs of his illegitimate child&mdash;that was
carrying tolerance or charity to a length unprecedented. He made no
allowance for the fact that she found herself confronted with a
situation in which to take action was to risk her domestic happiness.
What he scorned in her was the fact that she could be happy under such
circumstances. He knew very well that women put up with worse in the
very circles which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233"
name="pb233">233</a>]</span>he was struggling so desperately to attain;
but he knew also the veil of decent concealment which those circles
know so well how to assume. He had to admit, also, that she had proved
more of a philosopher than he had given her credit for being, and she
had dared to reprove him for his gibe, and he had apologized with God
knows what of contrition! The hunter instinct that is so strong in all
men rose up in him; and suddenly he realized why he had so
remorselessly wounded her and tormented her in those early days of
their acquaintance. It was that deep in his mind had lain the desire
for her, which still held, but which then he had been unwilling to
gratify by marriage; and proportionally as he had felt that she was out
of his reach and that he dared not insult her by one sign of
sentimentality unbacked by the desire of marriage, he had hated her
with the smouldering hatred of balked affection. Well, he loved her
still, and he was willing to marry her. If she could get rid of
Collingwood, he was willing to marry her. He hardly doubted that she
would do it. He felt pretty sure of the motives which had made her
marry the young ruffian, who had, he admitted, improved considerably
under her hands. She was a feminine <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>creature in spite of
her brains, unable to face life without love, and she had been grateful
to the man who offered it to her, and had given her the shelter of his
roof. But that any woman of Charlotte Collingwood&rsquo;s breeding
would deliberately prefer Martin Collingwood to a man of her own class,
Judge Alexander Barton declined to believe. Nor was he altogether
wrong. She might not have taken Collingwood in the beginning, had the
Judge been his honest rival at that time. But having taken him, she had
no intention of questioning her bargain. The Judge read her very
correctly up to that point of secret loyalty and gratitude, which to a
man of his ambitions was outside the possibilities of human nature.</p>
<p>Why should she not, he asked himself, get rid of Collingwood without
scandal and marry him. She was a woman to be proud of. He had seen her
at her husband&rsquo;s table and knew that she graced it. There must be
somewhere in the United States an influential kindred who might not
care to make too much of her as a nurse, but who would be glad to
welcome the wife of an eminent jurist; and with proper family backing,
the Judge saw many things. Why not a commissionership, yes, a
governorship? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>And then (for everybody knows that a Governor of
the Philippines has a great chance to keep in the public eye) why not
something better by-and-by? The Judge&rsquo;s visions grew more rosy
than it is safe to chronicle here.</p>
<p>Strange it was that his week of intimate association had not shown
him the utter futility and madness of thinking to approach Mrs.
Collingwood with the audacious plan he had in mind. Partly, his own
passion blinded his judgment; partly, he had so long been accustomed to
the society of women to whom social preferment is the end of life that
he had lost sight of the stronger and nobler elements of character that
can live in the feminine breast. To be just to the society in which the
Judge moved, there was a very fair sprinkling of noble women within it,
but his restless ambition drove him into intimacy with those who could
understand him and sympathize without the necessity of
explanations.</p>
<p>The result of his musings was that he went to luncheon in a
dangerous mood. It had full opportunity to show itself, for Mrs.
Maclaughlin did not appear. She sent word that she had been engaged in
the poultry yard all morning, had bathed late, and would prefer taking
her luncheon in her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236"
name="pb236">236</a>]</span>wrapper at home. As the Judge had caught a
glimpse of her drying her rather wiry gray tresses in the sunshine of a
window, he was able to corroborate her statement; and Charlotte laughed
as she gave orders for the preparation of the tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be trusted to see all things that you are not wanted
to see,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Then the Judge went point-blank and very indiscreetly at the matter
in his mind. &ldquo;Was that why you sent me away this morning?&rdquo;
he inquired.</p>
<p>For an instant her face flamed, and then the color left it white,
with an angry gleam in her eyes. She played with her teaspoon a minute,
and then she asked him a civil question about his impressions of her
school. It was his turn to flush. The rebuke was the more scathing for
its silence. His temper rose, and even in that instant he found time to
wonder why he should have such an infatuation for a woman who had such
power to enrage him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stand it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Charlotte was <span class="corr" id="xd20e2304" title=
"Source: dumfounded">dumbfounded</span>. She had her hospital patient
on her hands again, when she had imagined, for nearly a week, that she
had found a friend. Mechanically she pushed a dish of candied fruits
(they were at dessert) toward him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237"
href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>&ldquo;These are quite
fine,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;You had better try them and then
have your cigar. Meanwhile I must ask you to excuse me. My cook awaits
dinner directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was rising, but he reached a hand across and seized hers as it
rested on the table edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can put this scene off?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;You have got to listen. You had no business to marry Collingwood
in the first place. It is time the thing came to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Collingwood very quietly pulled her hand out of his grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said. She had the air of one who finds herself
incarcerated with a madman. Judge Barton leaned far across the table,
his eyes gleaming, his rather large, powerful face flushed, all the
brute strength of the man dominating the urbane jurist who said clever
things in a rich, well-modulated voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no business to marry him in the first place,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s done. Still you can change
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Collingwood, a very level intonation
of contempt in her tone. It irritated the Judge, and his vehemence rose
higher. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything can be changed in these days,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;I want you to divorce Collingwood and to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood. She did
not offer to rise, however. Her heart was swelling with anger,
humiliation, and a dull disappointment in the man in front of her. But
some unaccountable instinct held her listening to the end. She did want
to hear what he would say, she knew it would wound her, but she had a
very strong curiosity as to how far he would go; and a retrospect of
all her past association with him flashed through her mind. A faint
smile curved her lips as she remembered the weeks when he had been
free, had he so chosen, to make love to her. But he had not wanted to
make love to her, till, in the making, he violated all the laws of
right and loyalty. She sat very white and rigid, and the Judge felt in
her once again the woman who had challenged his old
self-complacency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it was natural,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You were
alone. You had to have your romance. But what will it be to
ours?&mdash;to ours? I&rsquo;ll be a lover to rival the lovers of
history&mdash;a husband&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll do some of the things we
want to do in this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239"
name="pb239">239</a>]</span>world. We have ambitions, both of us.
Dear&mdash;&rdquo; his voice dropped like a violin note on the
octave&mdash;&ldquo;take the same courage you had in hand to make this
mistake, and remedy it. You defied public opinion in marrying
Collingwood. Defy it once again to get rid of him. The world will
understand you better. Yes, by Jove! it will sympathize
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not test it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood. This time
she rose definitely. &ldquo;I thank God you are going away to-morrow.
The very air will be freer and cleaner after you have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood looking after her, red-eyed, enraged, yet longing with all
the fierce strength of his nature to seize her in his arms and conquer
her as Martin Collingwood had once conquered her. When he heard the
snap of her closing door, he fell into a sort of stupor, still sitting
at the table, his head resting on his clasped hands.</p>
<p>The vehement forceful fury of his mood fell away from him, and he
sat staring haggardly at the white cloth. The act was final, and having
committed it, he had full opportunity to question its discretion.
Strange tragedy of temperament, forcing eye and voice to utterance
which no human <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>power can revoke, though life itself would be
reckoned a fair price for revocation! Sitting there alone with his
thoughts, Alexander Barton was conscious of a shame that would stay
with him for life, of a futile hopeless anger and despair with himself,
of an ache that would take the taste out of life for many a month and
year to come.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Charlotte had passed into her room, where she stood very
quietly looking out of the window. Her heart lay heavy within her, and
a dull, gripping pain tugged at her throat. She had a sense of having
been morally bruised and beaten. For she saw with painful distinctness,
that it was not only brute feeling which had carried away Judge
Barton&rsquo;s self-control; but that deeper, subtler was his
measurement of the compromise she had made with life. It was not
Charlotte Collingwood&rsquo;s personality, it was what she had done
that opened the way to his advances.</p>
<p>After a time she lay down, and she remained so for the rest of the
afternoon, with her face buried in her pillow. How was she to face
Martin with the wretched story? How was she to dissemble her own
misery? She was a fair actress to the world, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>taking refuge in a kind of stoic dignity. But
how was she to hide her embarrassment and misery from the man who could
measure her moods as a barometer measures pressure? <span class=

<p class="first">The evening meal passed off more easily than had
seemed possible to Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s disturbed imagination.
Judge Barton managed to appear perfectly at ease, and she played her
own part better than she had fancied that she could. Only one dread
preyed upon her. There was a readiness in Kingsnorth to devote himself
to the entertainment of the guests, and a tact on his part in holding
the household together which made her suspect that keen observer of a
desire to aid her; and such a desire could only lead to the inference
that he had, to some extent, grasped the situation. The thought was
galling; but its bitterness was, for the time, mitigated by her sense
of need.</p>
<p>She slept little that night, but toward morning she fell into a doze
from which she was aroused by the sounds of breakfast preparations in
the next room. She jumped up hurriedly, only to behold the bathers
sporting in the sea, and the coastguard <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>cutter lying a mile
or so off shore. Dressing as quickly as she could she hastened down to
the beach in time to meet the Commissioner as he came ashore.</p>
<p>The Commissioner&rsquo;s first rush of enthusiasm had had time to
cool, and he had thought much during his week&rsquo;s absence. Without
in the least abating his very high opinion of Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s
personality and attainments, he had had time to consider the possible
attitude of Mrs. Commissioner, and the difficulties attendant upon too
close a connection with the queer island <i>m&eacute;nage</i>. The
result of his reflections was a self-conscious restraint, and a very
bungling masculine attempt to recede from a position without betraying
himself in the act.</p>
<p>Charlotte read his self-consciousness aright, ignored the existence
of a Mrs. Commissioner, saved his feelings for him, and bore him no
grudge. She had accepted her husband&rsquo;s associates kindly for his
sake; but she had never ceased to look upon them with the clear vision
of her upbringing. Socially Kingsnorth and the Maclaughlins were
&ldquo;impossible.&rdquo; It mattered little to her, because she had
turned her back forever upon society and all its works. She even took
satisfaction in playing her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>part gracefully. She enjoyed the
Commissioner&rsquo;s mystification, and the little access of deference
in his manner when he spoke to her.</p>
<p>She was saved the necessity of any direct speech with the Judge,
till, at the very last moment, he snatched a second while the others
were grouped around the Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare put out a hand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
I suppose you won&rsquo;t believe me when I say that I am sorry, and
that I didn&rsquo;t sleep last night for execrating myself. I am sorry
in the dullest, heart-sickest way a man can be. I knew as well before I
said those things as I know now that it would not do me any good, and
yet they had to come out. Well, I&rsquo;ve lost a friend. But do you
suppose you can ever think kindly of me again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes to him for one of those slow painful glances
that she sometimes gave, and she answered measuredly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think unkindly of you on my own account.
Somehow the thing has no bearing on me. I have seen you in the proper
light, and I do not think you are worth thinking unkindly about. But
for my husband&rsquo;s sake I shall always feel a resentment. He gave
you shelter under his roof, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245"
href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>a seat at his table; and in
turn you would have betrayed him. On his account, I shall always feel
anger, but for me you are just&mdash;erased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say, at least, as bitter things as other
women,&rdquo; the Judge retorted with pale lips. She shrugged her
shoulders lightly and extended a very high hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been such a pleasure to have you with us,&rdquo; she
said quite distinctly. Her eyes met his unflinchingly, but his own were
bright with moisture. He wrung her hand in spite of its high bent
wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give me a
good honest handshake. I&rsquo;m sorry. I shall be sorry for some time
to come. Besides&mdash;&rdquo; his expressive pause said as plainly as
words, &ldquo;You have conducted yourself admirably. The thing has done
you no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collingwood saw the shrug, the look exchanged, and the handshake. He
perceived war in his wife&rsquo;s manner, and he wondered what it was
all about. But as the Commissioner was already seating himself in the
human chair to be carried out to the boat there was no time to ask
questions then. He was still more surprised when his wife came up to
him, and slipping a hand in his, stood <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>watching the
departing dignitary. Charlotte had a horror of public demonstrations,
and the act was unlike her. He slipped an arm around her, glancing, as
he did so, somewhat sheepishly at his other guests; but the Judge was
apparently absorbed in the process of turning up the bottoms of an
exceedingly well made pair of trousers before embarking in turn; and,
as he was carried out, his anxiety to protect a pair of spotless shoes
seemed superior to every other consideration.</p>
<p>When the guests were once aboard their boat, the fishers made haste
to embark in their own; and Mrs. Collingwood, with a hasty wave of her
hand, turned immediately and went indoors.</p>
<p>She drew a long breath of relief as she entered her little
sitting-room. There was a sort of clearing in the atmosphere, a sense
of wholesomeness and content in having their lives to themselves. She
passed lovingly from one piece of furniture to another, giving a touch
here, making some slight change there. Her housekeeping cares became a
renewed pleasure. All day she busied herself about house and mending,
laying aside wholly the books and magazines which, for several hours
each day, had been her wonted entertainment. When Martin <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>came
home at five o&rsquo;clock, she met him, a radiant creature, eyes
smiling, face beaming content, her laugh spontaneous as a
child&rsquo;s. He was inclined to be lonely, and said as much at
dinner. Mrs. Maclaughlin agreed with him, but Maclaughlin and
Kingsnorth went over to Charlotte&rsquo;s side, and insisted that
things were cosier with their own little family.</p>
<p>After dinner, husband and wife sat on their veranda steps while
Martin smoked a pipe or two. He was very thoughtful, she silently
content. Suddenly he broke out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte, did you and the Judge quarrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte started perceptibly and answered after a decided
pause:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think we did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw your handshake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt rather than saw another little shrug. It was a reckless
gesture. Charlotte wanted very much to quarrel with her little gods
just then. She kept silence, however, and he was forced to go on
insistently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he try to make love to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a miserable humor in her reply. &ldquo;Not in your
acceptance of the term, Martin.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is my acceptance of the term? I should like to
know what you mean by that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not put his arm around my waist or try to kiss
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what were you scrapping with him for?&rdquo; said Martin
with such instant relief that Charlotte laughed helplessly, though the
tears were rolling down her cheeks. Martin studied her intently through
the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something behind all this,&rdquo; he remarked
sententiously. &ldquo;I never before knew you to dodge a question, or
to be in such a mood. Now, see here, I&rsquo;ve got some rights in this
matter and I want to know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone brought her up sharp in her half-hysterical mirth. She
replied quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not like it, Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to decide that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if nothing but the truth will do, he proposed to me
that I should get rid of you and marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collingwood threw down his cigar with an oath, and jumped, in the
sudden rush of his anger, quite clear of the steps. He made several
short, quick <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>turns back and forth before he finally sat down
again at his wife&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he had some reason for thinking you might entertain
such a proposition,&rdquo; he said bitterly.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s pride sprang to arms. &ldquo;He may have had
one,&rdquo; she replied laconically. &ldquo;It was not in any glance or
words I had given him. I haven&rsquo;t been flirting with him. My
conscience is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But men don&rsquo;t make propositions of that sort without a
reason, Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she said nothing. The answer was burning on her lips.
&ldquo;You are the reason. The associates you have given me here are
the reasons.&rdquo; But she maintained silence. Collingwood was angered
by what he thought her obstinacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what was the reason?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought I might be ambitious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an honest answer and as generous as it was frank. But
Collingwood was in no mood to measure generosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you let him get away without giving me a chance to kick
him into the Sulu Sea,&rdquo; he reproached her. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. The greatest fear I had was that he would not get away
without your doing it. Suppose you had kicked him&mdash;as you are
quite capable of doing&mdash;and he had kicked back. One or the other
would have been hurt. Suppose it had been you, do you think I should
have enjoyed seeing you suffer? Or suppose you had hurt him, do you
think it would have been a satisfaction to me to know that you had
fought for me, and had to be punished for it? Do I want my husband in
jail or maimed for rebuking an insolence that I could handle myself? I
defended your dignity and mine, and Judge Barton has been a thousand
times more rebuked by my tongue than he would have been by your
fists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this speech and with the memory of her shrug and handshake,
Martin&rsquo;s kindling jealousy had to be temporarily extinguished. He
returned with a more conciliating manner to the charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what you said to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Charlotte could suffer no more. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,
don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; she implored. She rose and walked away. The
action was the result of lifelong habit. She had never allowed herself
to indulge in emotion before others, and she had exercised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>almost the will of a red Indian to refrain from
giving way to an overwhelming burst of tears; but when, after she had
regained some control of herself, her thoughts returned to Collingwood,
a sense of bitter disappointment in him mingled with her self-pity.</p>
<p>He had not followed her! He had shown her no sympathy in her
momentary outburst of unhappiness. She was conscious of never having
deserved better of his loyalty and sympathy, and she had never received
less! She finally took up a book and endeavored to read, but her heart
was sick with wounded love and pride. She found old feelings that she
had believed scourged out of her being rising in tumultuous violence.
There was the feeling of outraged pride and sensibility, the swelling
sense of injustice, and a blind twisting and turning to see a way out
of the situation. Suddenly that which the Judge had proposed leaped
back into her mind. The ear which had been deaf to him when he appealed
to her ambitions became sensitively alive to a whisper when that
whisper promised succor from distaste. She was frightened at her own
attitude and took herself severely to task. She said to herself that
she was morbid, that Martin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=
"#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>had every right to be displeased
with her, for she had denied him frankness; but even as she ranged
these weights in her mind&rsquo;s eye the scale tipped lower and lower
with the weight of his displeasure.</p>
<p>Live under the bane of his anger she could not. The tentative
overtures, the timid looks or glances, the humility with which less
spirited women <span class="corr" id="xd20e2465" title=
"Source: propitate">propitiate</span> an injured deity were foreign to
her nature; but equally she was not calloused, as many women are, to
conjugal frowns.</p>
<p>All the self-confidence which she had gained in months of happiness
was jolted out of her at Martin&rsquo;s first angry word. Another woman
might have turned his wrath away with a laugh, might have nestled her
hand into his with a whisper and a kind look; but it was not in
Charlotte Collingwood to offer a caress to an angry husband. It would
have been to her an act beyond the pale of decency. Her heart harbored
no revenge. Every moment as she sat listening for his step, she
justified his resentment, she told herself over and over that she had
no tact and no consideration, and that Martin was an abused husband;
but to have risen and sought him when he was plainly averse to her
society <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>would have seemed to her the acme of
unwomanliness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Collingwood was pacing the sands. His temper was
seething. He did not understand the situation, and the more he realized
his inability to understand it, the higher rose his desire to hold
somebody accountable. There was no doubting the sincerity of
Charlotte&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I have not been flirting with
him,&rdquo; but Martin Collingwood thought there had to be a reason for
such a radical step on the part of so conservative a man as the Judge.
Then there was the fact that the Judge had departed without that closer
acquaintance with Martin Collingwood&rsquo;s footwear. To a man of
Collingwood&rsquo;s temperament, being balked of the physical pleasures
of revenge was worse even than the sting of the affront. Why had not
Charlotte told him? She had clearly not meant to tell him. She had
meant to let him go on shaking that viper by the hand when they met.
But why? Ah, that <i>why</i>!</p>
<p>It was long after midnight when he entered his home. His wife was
asleep or pretended to be so; and when he awoke late, after a troubled
sleep, he found her dressed and gone. From the adjoining <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>room, the clinking of cups and saucers told him
that breakfast was going on.</p>
<p>Collingwood dressed quickly and went in to breakfast wearing an
unpleasant face. After one quick glance, Charlotte gave him a smiling
good morning, to which he vouchsafed a surly reply.</p>
<p>Kingsnorth remarked: &ldquo;I thought I should have to go to work
without you, old man. Mrs. Collingwood would not have you waked. She
made us talk in whispers and eat in parenthesis, as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All tom-foolishness,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;I am no
six-weeks-old baby. You let me oversleep like this again,&rdquo; he
added, addressing the muchacho, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll beat you with a
dog whip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then electrically everybody knew that something was wrong in the
Collingwood household. Mrs. Maclaughlin stole a frightened look at
Charlotte whose face flamed, Maclaughlin stared first at Collingwood
and then at his wife, and finally turned his wondering eyes on
Kingsnorth, who met his gaze with an eye about as intelligent as that
of an oculist&rsquo;s advertisement. A moment later Charlotte addressed
some trifling remark to Kingsnorth who answered with a suspicious
readiness, and they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255"
name="pb255">255</a>]</span>fell into conversation unshared by the rest
of the table.</p>
<p>Collingwood continued to gloom after the Maclaughlins and
Kingsnorth, who had nearly finished when he appeared, had excused
themselves. Charlotte sat on profoundly uncomfortable. She had no words
in which to address his frowning majesty, but she was heartsick. She
rose at last, saying, &ldquo;If you will excuse me, Martin, I will
leave you to finish alone, I forgot about those launch supplies;&rdquo;
and she made her errand in the kitchen detain her until she saw the
launch puffing lazily across the blue, sparkling water.</p>
<p>She went back to her room and lay down half nauseated with the
misery surging within her. Nothing in her experience had prepared her
to meet the emergency she was confronting. She came of a family to whom
the scene which had taken place in her breakfast-room could be possible
only as a definite, final act of estrangement. She was as utterly
ignorant of those persons who alternately frown and smile and betray
joy or sorrow unthinkingly to the world as Martin was ignorant of the
jealous guarding of appearances which pertained to her world. It never
once occurred to her that Martin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>could publicly affront her at
breakfast and forget all about it before dinner.</p>
<p>Yet that is precisely what he did. The day&rsquo;s work restored his
natural sunny self. He dismissed the Judge from his mind with the
mental reservation of kicking him on sight; and when he came home that
night, he strode up the steps, caught his wife in his arms, and kissed
her as naturally as if they had not, that very morning, omitted that
lover&rsquo;s benediction for the first time since their marriage.</p>
<p>He made no apology for his late spleen. Truth is, he hardly thought
of it as affecting her. She clung to him as he kissed her, and he saw
that she was pale and her eyes heavily lidded; but he asked her no
questions. She had had, in truth, a hard day. As soon as the glowering
man body was safely out of the way, Mrs. Maclaughlin came over, bent on
extracting information. In her life and in the lives of most of her
friends, connubial difficulties meant neighborhood confidences and
lamentations. Charlotte parried her hints and, to a point-blank
question, returned a look so rebuking that Mrs. Maclaughlin went home
in high dudgeon. For the rest of the day, Charlotte struggled against
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>the tears that would have betrayed
her&mdash;struggled till her eyeballs ached and her weary head seemed
drawn back upon her shoulders.</p>
<p>At dinner Kingsnorth stole one furtive glance, said to himself
&ldquo;Thoroughbred, by Jove,&rdquo; and bent himself to seconding Mrs.
Collingwood&rsquo;s conversational efforts. After dinner they all
played bridge till eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>So the whole incident was passed over without speech between husband
and wife. But with it went the completeness, the golden, unreal joy of
their honeymoon. Though they walked and talked together, and played at
being lovers again, a sense of distrust hung over their relations.
Collingwood secretly nursed his <i>why</i>; his wife still asked
herself proudly if she had deserved public humiliation at his hands.
Led by an evil genius he could not have selected a more adroit way to
offend her and to arouse her critical faculties against him than that
he had chosen. Private reproaches she could have endured with more
fortitude than she could endure public sulking.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she made a Spartan effort to clear him at her own
expense, and a no less loyal attempt to conceal from him that a wound
still rankled in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258"
name="pb258">258</a>]</span>her breast. But it did rankle, and, in the
next six weeks, it seemed to her that she and Martin grew steadily
apart; that in spite of every effort to stay the widening process, it
went on slowly and relentlessly, and that it was leading them gradually
but inevitably to that moment which she had so greatly dreaded before
her marriage.</p>
<p>It was the custom at the island for the three men to take turns in
going to Manila for commissaries, and to dispose of their pearls and
shells. Collingwood had been engaged in this work the year before, when
he met with the accident which landed him in the hospital; the
Maclaughlins had been up since Charlotte&rsquo;s marriage, and the next
trip was Kingsnorth&rsquo;s. But as the time drew near, he astounded
them all by the announcement that he did not want to go, and that he
wished Collingwood to take his place. When pressed for a reason for his
apparent insanity, he declared that if a man had to live in purgatory
or a worse place, he had better stay there all the time, and not seek
spots that would emphasize its drawbacks when he returned to it. He
insisted that Collingwood enjoyed Manila while to him it was the
extreme of boredom, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href=
"#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>Martin ought to take his wife away
for a change, that her spirits were drooping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;I am absolutely
contented. I don&rsquo;t feel droopy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Collingwood had taken alarm. He stared at her. &ldquo;But you
<i>are</i> a bit pale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder why I had not
noticed it. Besides, I should like to be in Manila again with you.
Let&rsquo;s accept. Kingsnorth proposed it himself. He can&rsquo;t
complain if we take him at his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, Mrs. Maclaughlin put in a bomb. &ldquo;Why
can&rsquo;t I go too, then?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a housekeeper,&rdquo; cried Kingsnorth, while
Maclaughlin remarked hastily, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;You can get along by
yourself a while. It&rsquo;s just the thing. Charlotte will have
somebody for company while I am at business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, Charlotte was ready with a smile and an echo of his
remark. Kingsnorth grew morose while Mrs. Maclaughlin began to
enumerate the things which actually demanded her presence in Manila.
Maclaughlin gave her one or two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>frowns; but she had taken the
bit in her teeth; and it was soon decided that she was to have her
way.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s heart sank and her anticipation of pleasure
subsided into dread. Mrs. Maclaughlin was, at all times, a trial to
her. She had little sympathy with the self-complacent temperament which
is not subject to atmospheric influences; and Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s
society seemed to her several degrees less desirable in Manila than it
did in Maylubi. She made no objection, however, and even succeeded in
forcing herself to a half-hearted share in Martin&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 id="xd20e2541" class="main">Chapter XIII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was all finally settled, and preparations such as
could be made were begun. Charlotte found that, with a prospect of
returning to the world, a variety of interests which she had thought
quite extinct revived and grew clamorous. Memory was busy, too, with
the days of her courtship. That strange mingling of ecstasy and misery
through which she had passed seemed quite remote and, in retrospect,
quite unnecessary. A hundred times she asked herself why she had been
such a goose, why she had hesitated, why she had permitted the possible
opinion of the world at large to influence her. She went about almost
uplifted with the sense of new moral independence.</p>
<p>Collingwood was childishly eager for the change. His head, too, was
full of memories and of places&mdash;how they would revisit the place
where such and such a conversation had taken place,&mdash;did she
remember that wrestle of their two individualities,&mdash;or drive over
the ground where he had pleaded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262"
href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>so fiercely for the right to
take care of her, to stand between her and the bread-and-butter
struggle. Particularly he looked forward to the Luneta evenings, for,
of all moments in his life, he held that moment on the Luneta when she
had dropped her flag the sweetest. He said as much to her, and she
blushed like a girl. He also said something to the same effect to Mrs.
Mac when that lady was sharpening her imagination one evening at
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to run off and leave you just once, Mrs.
Mac,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one drive with my wife all
planned out; it will be a Sunday evening. I am going to take her to the
Luneta that evening; just <i>she</i> and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can understand,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Mac. &ldquo;For
that matter, Mac and I were young once ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingsnorth, who had preserved a kind of displeased reticence ever
since it had been settled that Mrs. Mac was to go to Manila with the
Collingwoods, started to say something, bestowed upon the lady an
unfriendly glance, and somewhat pointedly asked Mrs. Collingwood if she
was going to join the bridge game after dinner. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>Charlotte smiled across the table at her husband. &ldquo;Not unless
I&rsquo;m actually needed,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hate it so badly, you&rsquo;ll have to be excused,&rdquo;
Collingwood said. &ldquo;Better let Kingsnorth take you for a stroll.
You need exercise and his temper needs sweetening. He has been in a
devilish mood all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me feel like a prescription,&rdquo; said Charlotte,
laughingly. &ldquo;Mr. Kingsnorth, if your temper does not improve
after a dose of my society, my husband&rsquo;s faith in me as a panacea
for all troubles of the mind will have gone forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I note that fact,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth, gravely. &ldquo;I
commit myself now to come back grinning like a Cheshire cat.&rdquo; But
he knew, in spite of her light manner, that Charlotte was displeased.
It was seldom that she permitted herself the least badinage with him;
and he recognized it nearly always as a cloak to cover some hasty and
more aggressive instinct.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when they started away after dinner, she fell into a
more intimate tone with him than she generally used. The sunset was
just dying out, and its flaming radiance seemed to exaggerate the wide
sweep of the waters, the white <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264"
href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>stretch of sand, and the
lithe, swaying boles of the cocoanut groves. Charlotte paused to look
about her in a sudden rush of tenderness for the solitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful how contented one can be in such a situation
as this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am amazed at myself. I am never sad,
seldom even lonely. I have a feeling, at times, that this could go on
and on and on in endless &aelig;ons, and I could ask no more than one
day&rsquo;s sunshine and that same day&rsquo;s sunset. It is
inexplicable and yet it is all in myself; anything to upset that
harmony between my soul and this could make it a nightmare, an endless
nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is to me,&rdquo; Kingsnorth rejoined. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know why I stand it from day to day. I don&rsquo;t see how
mere dollars and cents can compensate for stagnating here. Yet I am
such a slave to the dollar that I do stay; the good Lord only knows
when I shall go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you gave up your trip, you pretended to feel about this
as you don&rsquo;t feel. Why did you do it, Mr. Kingsnorth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you and Martin to go. You can say what you please
about being satisfied and contented; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>some of your radiance
and vitality have disappeared in the last two or three
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte flushed uncomfortably. She did not enjoy the thought that
she was so closely watched and studied. Kingsnorth, divining her
thoughts, went on hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, I am as miserable there as here. I want the
impossible. I&rsquo;m crying for the moon. I&rsquo;ve cried for
it&mdash;My God!&mdash;these twenty years. I wonder, Mrs. Collingwood,
if you can understand a mood of savage self-dissatisfaction&mdash;a
mood in which it seems indecent that you should be alive yourself, and
unjust that so many million fellow-beings should find this world an
agreeable place. There are times when I should like to be an Atlas
poised on the gulf of space! How I&rsquo;d send the old ball and all
that dwell in it humming into the void, to go on and on into darkness!
You know that poem of Byron&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know the poem and the mood.&rdquo; She regretted the
statement as soon as she had made it, and bit her lips in silent
confusion. Kingsnorth stopped and faced her. They stood close to a
great clump of pandan bushes where a path, making a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>short cut from the cottages to the point, led
away through the bunched sand grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to draw that line on me forever, Mrs.
Collingwood?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Mr. Kingsnorth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do. I am Martin&rsquo;s friend, Mrs.
Collingwood. Am I never going to be yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as far as it is a friendship including Martin, yes. But
why fence over the matter? The friendship which you would form with me
excludes him. I should have poor powers of analysis, Mr. Kingsnorth, if
I could not perceive that you have not been bidding for the friendship
of a friend&rsquo;s wife, as she is joined to his life and yours in the
present. What you want is a friendship based on the past. You want to
build something out of what we have both experienced and what he has
not experienced, and I will have nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant no disloyalty to him,&rdquo; Kingsnorth muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disloyalty; no! But would he feel his position a dignified
one? Would he have no cause for complaint with both you and
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You coddle him,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth, with a short bitter
laugh. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am jealous for all that touches his dignity as well as
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingsnorth lost his head. &ldquo;Why did you marry him?&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I married him because I was in love with him, Mr. Kingsnorth.
I haven&rsquo;t regretted it. I love him better to-day, if it were
possible, than I did then. I have answered your question because I was
able to answer it frankly; but, none the less, I resent its
impertinence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I apologize. But you will admit, lady of the stony heart,
that there are situations that provoke human curiosity past the limits
of all good manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte stood tapping one foot on the ground a long while before
she spoke. She was thinking deeply, and the result of her meditations
was a sudden appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kingsnorth,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;I should like
to put this matter honestly before you. You and I find ourselves in a
peculiar situation. When I first came here I was utterly taken aback by
your presence. You saw my confusion. You probably read it aright, and I
saw in your eyes, that first morning, the question which you have just
asked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>me. The answer is easy, and yet not easy to
make. For the sake of human affection in my life, to escape a
loneliness and a sense of isolation that were almost intolerable to me,
I compromised with my ambitions. I know how you and all the rest of the
world&mdash;or, at least, that part of it in which you and I were
brought up&mdash;regard my marriage. All the same, I do not regret it,
and my life with Martin has been full of happiness. I don&rsquo;t
intend to jeopardize one drop of that happiness. I have steadily
refused to drift into any relations with you that could startle
Martin&rsquo;s mind into recognition of facts which he is blind to, and
which I choose to ignore. Are you so selfish that, for the sake of a
few idle hours, a few reminiscences, perhaps, you would ask me to risk
the dearest possession I have in the world&mdash;my husband&rsquo;s
unalloyed pleasure in our own relations, his perfect confidence in
himself?&rdquo; She drew a long breath. &ldquo;It would be a sacrilege.
I&rsquo;ll guard his happy self-confidence as I would guard my own
self-respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That self-confidence of his is deuced irritating to the
onlooker.&rdquo; Then with a burst of anger, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
forgive me for being myself, but you <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>will forgive him for
bringing you here and expecting you to associate with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The association has done me no harm, Mr.
Kingsnorth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;ve treated me like a
leper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have treated you with the courtesy and consideration which
any woman owes to her husband&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve measured it out drop by drop, as you would
medicine in a glass; just as you&rsquo;ll measure out courtesy to Mrs.
Maclaughlin on this trip. Good Lord! Mrs. Collingwood, you can&rsquo;t
have that woman at your heels in Manila. What is Martin thinking of?
Let me give him a hint for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare,&rdquo; she cried, her face crimsoning,
her eyes beginning to flash. Then with a sudden repression of her
feelings, &ldquo;What evil genius inspires this desire to interfere?
Why can you not leave me to manage my own affairs? Martin is pleased at
the idea of Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s going, and that is enough for
me.&rdquo; Then she began to laugh softly. &ldquo;Please, Mr.
Kingsnorth, let this be the last time that you and I discuss my
personal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>affairs or Martin&rsquo;s. Martin and I have a
little Garden of Eden of our own, but I am no primitive Eve. With my
consent, he shall not eat of the fruit of the tree of
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingsnorth turned around with a shrug. &ldquo;How long do you think
you can keep it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as we live in Maylubi, at the least. I hope
forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another day,&rdquo; said Collingwood&rsquo;s voice, as he
stepped into the path clear in view from behind the pandan bushes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been listening to this jargon for ten minutes. Now I
should like to know what it means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingsnorth did not start or utter a word; he only stared defiantly
at Collingwood. He was conscious of a low repressed sound from Mrs.
Collingwood, who stood as if turned to stone, her gaze fixed not on her
husband, but on Kingsnorth. She was nibbling a ratched edge of pandan
fibre which she had stripped as they talked; but her expression was one
of bitter accusation. Plainly she held him responsible for the
conversation he had forced upon her, and the betrayal which had
ensued.</p>
<p>Collingwood was white and his brown eyes glittered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>with
an uncanny lustre. He was holding himself in with a strong hand.</p>
<p>It was Charlotte who spoke first. &ldquo;At what point did you enter
the conversation, Martin?&rdquo; she inquired suavely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t enter. But I judge I heard from the beginning.
Mrs. Mac found she had something else to do, and Mac wanted to read; so
I came across, short cut, to join you. I waited a minute, intending to
scare you, and then what I heard made me want to hear more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte gave a little reckless shrug, and turned her face seaward.
Her expression cut Kingsnorth to the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you heard from the beginning, you must see that I forced a
conversation on Mrs. Collingwood that she disliked,&rdquo; he said
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I got that all right. I&rsquo;m not playing the
jealous husband. Charlotte&rsquo;s all right; so are you, for that
matter. What I&rsquo;d like to have explained is this compromise
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte raised her eyes to his. A leaden pain seemed to make them
heavy and spiritless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need explanations, Martin,&rdquo; she said.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>&ldquo;Would to Heaven you did; though I&rsquo;d
tear my tongue out by the roots before I would give them, if you really
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I gathered the point,&rdquo; Martin replied bitterly.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to be said. It makes a thousand things
that have mystified me plain as day. You&rsquo;ve deceived me.
You&rsquo;ve played a nasty part. It does you small credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingsnorth started to move away. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo;
Martin said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any reason to be sensitive about
discussing this thing before you. You seemed to be admitted to things
before I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned what my eyes and wits told me. I give you my word
of honor that until to-night Mrs. Collingwood and I have never spoken
of you or of your and her private affairs. What she said to me was in
self-defence and only to parry an insistence that I sincerely
regret.&rdquo; He turned toward Charlotte appealingly, but she made a
fierce little movement as if to wave away anything apologetic he might
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a damned interesting comedy,&rdquo; Martin
went on, the words stinging like sleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Charlotte. She put up a hand. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>&ldquo;I have never deceived you, Martin. If you
recall the day on which you left the hospital, and on which you came to
me and asked me to marry you, you will remember that I spelt out with
almost painful distinctness the things which have been alluded to
to-night. You simply refused to listen to them. You would not
understand. Every word fell on deaf ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re sensitive enough now, I understand the
situation. You&rsquo;ve simply reversed the squawman act. You wanted a
home and somebody to love you, and you took what you could get, not
what you wanted. And you said to yourself that it did not matter, for
you never expected to go home, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have to show me
to your friends. That&rsquo;s all very fine, from the squawman&rsquo;s
view-point. It&rsquo;s practical. But by the living God I&rsquo;m no
squaw, to be content with my position! You&rsquo;re not proud of me, I
see. Damnation! do you think I&rsquo;ll live with you, or any woman
that walks the earth, on those terms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an instant&rsquo;s silence. Collingwood somewhat relieved
by his own violence, glared at the woman, who, up to that hour, had
never known less than tenderness from him. Kingsnorth stood
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>bowed with shame and repentance. For an instant
Charlotte&rsquo;s frozen glance met her husband&rsquo;s. Then with an
unconscious gesture she laid one hand on her constricted throat, and,
turning, took the path across the grove. Her white figure moved so
lightly that they could not realize the difficulty with which she
walked. But as the shadows of the tall cocoanut trees closed around
her, she grasped a slender bole with both arms and leaned against it,
panting. Nausea swept over her. Despair, humiliation, hopelessness
weighed her down. Her knees trembled beneath her, and with a little
moan, too soft to reach the ears of the two men, who remained
motionless, she sank at the foot of the tree.</p>
<p>She lay there a long time, unable to rise, though she was not
fainting. Weakness had fastened upon her. But under her breath she kept
on repeating one sobbing phrase:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair! It isn&rsquo;t fair&mdash;three men
against one woman. They are so hard. They aren&rsquo;t generous. It
isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length Collingwood turned abruptly and walked down the beach.
Kingsnorth came out of his stupor and pursued him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Collingwood,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;if I were not
such a blackguard myself, I&rsquo;d call you one, for your treatment of
your wife. She&rsquo;s had no chance between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can take care of herself, I think. My advice to you is to
keep out of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I? I&rsquo;ve been the cause of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the cause!&rdquo; Martin stared an instant and broke into
a short, ugly laugh. &ldquo;Do you suppose I care for that talk out
there to-night? You did me a favor. What I care about is the part
I&rsquo;ve played for the last ten months. A devilish pretty dupe
I&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingsnorth recognized the futility of argument with a man whose
self-love has been so sorely wounded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see this
thing differently when you cool down,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything more to your wife. She&rsquo;s a noble
woman, Martin, a damned sight too good for you, if you want the truth;
and you&rsquo;ve half killed her to-night. Hold in till you&rsquo;ve
had time to get your second thoughts. If you want to beat my face in,
I&rsquo;ll stand it. God! I&rsquo;m certain it would be a
relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s reply was an inarticulate grunt, as he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>flung up the path to his own cottage. He charged
up the steps through the lighted <i>sala</i>, and into the bedroom,
expecting to find Charlotte there. The desire to quarrel was strong in
him.</p>
<p>The empty room surprised him, and for an instant jolted his thoughts
into a less combative vein. He went out and sat down on the veranda
steps, chewing the end of an unlighted cigar, and expecting each minute
to see her white-clad figure emerge from the dark line of the cocoanut
grove. Gloomy thoughts seized upon his mind.</p>
<p>The chiming of the <i>sala</i> clock brought him to a sudden
realization that it was eleven o&rsquo;clock and Charlotte had not
returned. Alarm overcame his rage, and he started hastily up the path
through the grove. He almost stumbled over her before he saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of Heaven are you doing here?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;Get up and come home at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to obey him, but it was with the third unassisted effort
only that she dropped her head with a moan that went to his heart.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get up. I would if I could.&rdquo; And Martin
stooped and lifted her to her feet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you walk?&rdquo; he asked. His voice trembled.</p>
<p>She nodded and dragged herself along with his aid. Collingwood was
thoroughly frightened. He helped her to her room, where she fell on her
bed nerveless. No fury could have blinded him to her utter exhaustion,
to the set despair of her face. He went into the dining-room and
brought her a glass of whiskey. When she had drunk it, a bit of color
came back into her face and she looked at him appealingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more to-night, please, Martin. If
you&rsquo;ll go out on the veranda, I&rsquo;ll get myself to bed
without assistance. I can&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo; Her teeth chattered.</p>
<p>Collingwood, half sulky still, half compassionate, betook himself to
the veranda and a succession of cigars. Away from the sight of her
suffering, anger and humiliation sat again upon his shoulders. When in
the wee small hours, he sought his room, he asked her grouchily if she
had slept, or if he could do anything for her. To both questions she
uttered a denial. It was evident that she had not been crying though
she looked very pale and worn; and the next morning she was unable to
rise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It seemed to Mrs. Collingwood that the next three days
embodied the quintessence of all that had ever fallen to her lot of
discomfort and misery. To lie physically helpless, a burden and a care
to the one person who, at that time, was most out of love with her, was
humiliation of the most cankering variety. Added to it was the sense of
loss, the consciousness of ruin and disaster, and a feeling of shame
that bowed her to the earth. Her husband&rsquo;s bitter words had sunk
deep into her soul. She saw herself as a creature degraded and
partaking of the instincts of the most depraved class. Her marriage
began to assume the complexion of an adventure. Was there an element of
the adventuress in her? she asked herself tremulously. In reply came a
wild rush of denial, an agony of revolt. As she envisaged herself she
could not but justify her own actions. The feminine weakness, and dread
of life&rsquo;s bread-and-butter struggle, alone justified them. And
she had loved <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>Martin tenderly; she had been a good wife, loyal
to his interests, guarding his dignity as her own, literally pouring
her affection and her gratitude for all his tenderness toward her into
his carelessly outstretched palm. No mother ever more sedulously stood
between her child and the evil of the world than she had sought to save
Martin Collingwood the pain of knowing what he had come to know. His
ingratitude, though she would not use that word even to herself, cut
her to the depths of her heart.</p>
<p>But it was plain that their romance was ended; &ldquo;the thing had
gone to smash,&rdquo; in Collingwood&rsquo;s forceful language. Time
and time again she went over that night on the Luneta before their
marriage, and Martin&rsquo;s words, and her own miserable doubts and
fears. The worst had happened, as she had feared it might, but
Collingwood was not living up to his philosophy. He was angry at her,
held himself a man cheated, put all the blame on her, wanted in a dumb,
fruitless way to quarrel with her.</p>
<p>On the evening of her second day in bed, they attempted to thresh
out their difficulties, but it was soon evident that they had reached a
hopeless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span><i>impasse</i>. Charlotte ended what was a
miserable controversy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your quarrel with me about, Martin?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Simply that I am I, that I have lived through certain
experiences, that I have certain criterions of taste and judgment that
you have not. I have not obtruded them on you. I haven&rsquo;t made
myself obnoxious by them. I deny that I have ever deceived you, and I
have tried honestly to think and feel as you do. I <i>haven&rsquo;t</i>
been playing a part. I have been thoroughly happy. But you can&rsquo;t
any more make me put your values on life and people, than you can,
because somebody wishes you to, convince yourself that there is no
America; that all your past life has been a dream; that all you have
known and felt and seen has been mere imagination, a fancy on your
part. I&rsquo;ll have no quarrel with you, no reproaches. I married you
of my own free will, and married you for love. As for my philosophy of
life or my views on worldly matters, what actual part need they play in
our life? If I am content to put them out of sight, why cannot you do
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned if I&rsquo;ll live with any woman on
earth on your terms,&rdquo; Collingwood reiterated. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>She looked him steadily in the eyes. &ldquo;Then the thing is
finally settled, and we can spare ourselves the pain of useless
discussion. For in the thing we are quarrelling with&mdash;not my
actions, but my philosophy of life&mdash;I shall not change. Nor can I
fancy any woman with a spark of modesty or decency in her, entreating a
man to live with her. If you will allow me to remain here during your
stay in Manila, I&rsquo;ll go before you get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you think you are going to live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little reckless shrug. &ldquo;I supported myself before
we were married. I suppose I can do so again. I&rsquo;ll make no
demands on your pocket book. I didn&rsquo;t marry you to be supported.
I married you to be loved by you, to feel that I gave in your life and
home an order and an assistance&mdash;yes, and a joy&mdash;to equalize
what I cost you in money. When there is no longer exchange, I refuse to
accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big talk,&rdquo; said Martin. She did not reply, but turned
away wearily. The servant knocked at the door a minute after to say
that dinner was ready, and he went to his meal. After that, it seemed
that they had subsided into a tacit acceptance of their future as she
had outlined it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282"
name="pb282">282</a>]</span></p>
<p>Collingwood was quite as unhappy as his wife was. All his masculine
pride was chafing, but his masculine heart was aching. He wanted to be
set gloriously in the right, to ascend the pedestal from which he had
been ignominiously tumbled by a few incautious words overheard. He
wanted, though he hardly phrased it to himself, apologies for his
wife&rsquo;s daring to understand a thing that he had not understood.
He had literally eaten of the tree of knowledge and was enraged with
what lay patent to his seared vision.</p>
<p>The consciousness of what had been going on in Kingsnorth&rsquo;s
mind, in Judge Barton&rsquo;s, in the Commissioner&rsquo;s, burnt like
acid on a wound. He saw, with astonishing clearness, Judge
Barton&rsquo;s viewpoint, and he marvelled no more at that
gentleman&rsquo;s temerity. His beggar maid a princess! his throne a
<i>m&eacute;salliance</i>!&mdash;the thought burned. His tortured
self-love yawned like an abyss which no heaping of prostrate offenders
could ever fill; and against his wife&rsquo;s quiet dignity his
thwarted will raged sullenly.</p>
<p>Yet it is doubtful if he ever really regarded their separation as
probable. Tacitly he accepted her statement that she was going away. In
reality <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>he hardly thought of such a possibility. Alone
with his thoughts, all his will and his imagination bent itself to her
conquest. It was that hour of her final humiliation and confession to
which he looked forward. How long was she going to keep it up?</p>
<p>During her few days&rsquo; illness, however, he showed her some
courtesies for which she returned a dignified, but not an affectionate,
gratitude. Indeed, she had been up and about the house two or three
days before her husband perceived that the door of her heart and mind,
which she had so shyly opened to him, had closed, and that he stood
outside of it, a part of that concourse which Charlotte Ponsonby had
always feared and distrusted. She had trusted him most of all the
world, and he had turned upon her and hurt her more cruelly than anyone
else had ever done. Without reproach or lamentation or any sign of
self-pity, she retired behind those invincible ramparts to which Martin
had been blind in hospital days, but to which he was now so much
alive.</p>
<p>It would have been exceedingly difficult for him to tell in what the
change consisted. Her courtesy was finely measured, it is true, but it
was not an armed truce between belligerents. It was the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>refuge of dignity, of one who feels his position
false, but would save appearances by outward grace, at least. She who
had been his wife, his dearest possession, became only a graceful
hostess in his home&mdash;a lady who stood ready to lend a deferential
ear to his suggestions, or carry out, to the best of her ability, his
every wish, expressed or unexpressed. She ignored his gloom, saw to all
his needs, spoke to him always kindly, though without humility or
contrition; but for herself she asked not one fraction of his time or
his attention. The occasions for little courtesies which he had been
accustomed to offer her were skilfully avoided; but were never rudely
made conspicuous by their avoidance. Her quiet pride was infinitely
more than a match for his aggressive self-love; her supreme
naturalness, the most impregnable armor she could have worn.</p>
<p>Kingsnorth beheld the transformation in her, was first astonished,
then interested, then moved to profound pity and contrition. With tact
equal to her own, he set himself to meet the situation, seconded all
her efforts to make their awkward meals natural and easy, silenced Mrs.
Mac&rsquo;s gaping curiosity, and managed, in doing it all, to keep
himself well in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285"
name="pb285">285</a>]</span>the background. With Collingwood he had one
conversation on the launch, but the sum and substance was that
gentleman&rsquo;s reiteration of the terms on which he would live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; was Kingsnorth&rsquo;s irritable response,
&ldquo;you are simply making an ass of yourself, Collingwood. I
can&rsquo;t call you a brute, because I&rsquo;ve been too much of one
myself. I live in glass houses&mdash;I can&rsquo;t throw stones.
You&rsquo;ve married a jewel among women, and you&rsquo;re going to
make your ruffled dignity make smash of two lives that ought to be
happy. Moreover, you are not in earnest. This is all bluffing and bad
temper to bring Mrs. Collingwood to her knees, and to make her put
herself in the wrong when you know there isn&rsquo;t any wrong or right
about things. Now I&rsquo;ll give you a piece of advice, old man. You
are trying that game on the wrong woman: see that you don&rsquo;t carry
it too far, and turn her affection into dislike. I&rsquo;ve learned one
thing, learned it tragically well in this life; and that is that one
has just <i>one</i> chance really in this world with one person. Now
don&rsquo;t lose your chance with your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Martin vouchsafed a grunt. Hardly conscious of it, he had
set his will to bring Charlotte <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286"
href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>to his terms. He could not
listen to anything that crossed that strong desire.</p>
<p>The days went by slowly where they had once gone so fast, and
neither husband nor wife referred again to that tacit agreement of
separation. Yet Martin knew from the bundle of letters which he was to
carry up to Manila that Charlotte was making plans for business life
again; and once, when he came into the sitting-room unexpectedly, he
found her frowning over her bank book. He knew the balance it
contained, for, on their wedding journey, they had laughed at her
little savings; and he knew she could not long maintain herself upon
it. He smiled grimly at her flushed discomfiture when he found her
pondering ways and means, and somewhat brutally said to himself that
she would find that she had little rope to run upon.</p>
<p>Yet at the last moment it was he who wavered, he who rang down the
curtain on their make-believe. She had looked after his garments and
had packed his trunk with wifely solicitude; had prepared for his
launch trip, foods for which she knew his predilection, and had, at the
moment of farewell, saved the situation by putting out a friendly hand.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope you will have a pleasant trip,&rdquo; she
said,&mdash;and what it cost her to speak so easily and naturally, only
she could have told,&mdash;&ldquo;and thank you for giving me the weeks
here to get ready. I&rsquo;ll go over to Cuyo when the launch goes up
for you on your return trip, and will leave a letter for you there.
There are some things I can&rsquo;t say to you, but I should like to
write them. They will, perhaps, leave a better feeling between
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To these words Martin found, at the time, no answer. He wrung her
hand, muttered something, and hastened away. Yet when his belongings
had all been deposited in the boat, and the men were waiting to
&ldquo;chair&rdquo; him out, he turned on his heel, and strode back to
the cottage.</p>
<p>He took her by surprise, for she had not stayed to watch him. Her
impulse had been to scream, to weep, to give some vent to the pain that
wrenched soul and body; and in the determination to keep hold upon
herself she had gone straight to the back of the house, and was
wrestling there with a refractory lock on a cupboard. She turned at his
step a face drawn, white, and frozen into lines of pain, and looked at
him with eyes that asked and yet were proudly defiant. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span></p>
<p>He went straight up to her and took her in his arms; and though she
relaxed and her head lay passive on his shoulder, there thrilled
through them both the sense of conflict, of individuality set against
individuality. Their embrace did not lessen the strain, and after an
instant, something of his own fierce grasp relaxed, and they stood, the
dumb victims of emotions that were stronger than their wills, stronger
than their aching desires to be at peace with each other.</p>
<p>She turned at length and looked at him with eyes of misery.
&ldquo;Oh, go!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred times worse
than I ever thought anything could be. Think kindly of me as I do of
you. We can&rsquo;t help ourselves. I knew this hour. I felt it when we
were happiest. It had to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want you to do,&rdquo; Martin said honestly, &ldquo;is
to take into consideration my care for you and my protection. I can
take care of you&mdash;can do it well. That ought to count for
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my poor boy, has it not always counted? I&rsquo;ve leaned
on you and your love, Martin. I&rsquo;ve told you so a thousand
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you set against them a lot of trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t set the trifles against them. I have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>never weighed one against the other&mdash;never
for an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know that you could.&rdquo; Poor Martin here uttered
helplessly what was, after all, at the bottom of his spleen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge me by what I
know; judge me by what I&rsquo;ve done and thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to change,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m right. You&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things you have in mind can&rsquo;t be changed by will
power, dear. They are the results of education, association,
environment. New environment may change them gradually. What you ask I
cannot give. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done all I can do, come as far to meet
you as I can.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not stubborn, Martin. I would do
anything in my power to meet your wishes. You are quarrelling not with
what I do, but with what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was a grunt of impatience as Martin flung away again. He
raged helplessly against the truth of her words.</p>
<p>When, at last, the launch was hull down on the sky line, Charlotte
went to bed, and shutting out Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s insistent
curiosity, permitted herself the luxury of nearly a week&rsquo;s
retirement. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>Though at times she wept, for the most part she
tried to shut out the past, and to concentrate her thoughts on the
future. Collingwood&rsquo;s idea that her dread of business life would
outweigh her sense of humiliation and her wounded self-love was
entirely wrong. She shrank, it is true, from the world; but the thought
that there was an alternative never suggested itself to her.
Collingwood had said that he would not live with her, or what had
seemed to her the equivalent of that. She took him at his word. The
fact that legally he was her husband counted no more in her summing up
of the situation than if he had been a chance stranger encountered in
the street. Live for an hour more than was absolutely necessary under
the same roof with a man who entertained such feelings for her? She
turned sick at the thought.</p>
<p>When at last she emerged from her retirement she was the woman of
hospital days, the super-sensitive orphan, feeling herself unwelcome to
all the world, everybody&rsquo;s hand against her, her hand against
everybody; but she took them, as Kingsnorth phrased it to himself, in
the hollow of her own hand. In the presence of her reserve, even Mrs.
Maclaughlin&rsquo;s frank speech grew guarded. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>Kingsnorth merely looked at her in a kind of
mute apology. Again and again she caught his glance with its furtive
appeal; but each time her own eyes met it, not with studied blankness,
but with a naturalness that was almost histrionic.</p>
<p>Maclaughlin had returned with the launch before her seclusion was at
an end, and after a family discussion of what was patent to their eyes,
he went vigorously on her side. She was &ldquo;gentle folks,&rdquo; he
maintained, a deal sight too good for Martin Collingwood; and
Collingwood was behaving like a fool. Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s
democratic partiality, naturally roused in Martin&rsquo;s favor, was
somewhat rudely snubbed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=

<p class="first">It was at the end of a month, when Charlotte looked
forward with increasing dread to her husband&rsquo;s return and to her
own departure, that the lorcha <i>Dos Hermanos</i>, their tried friend,
left cargo and letters at the island. Collingwood wrote that he should
delay his return another month. He sent down their commissaries, and
Maclaughlin was to come up to Romblon harbor to meet the first June run
of the <i>Puerta Princesa</i> steamer. Most of these details were
contained in a letter to Maclaughlin. His letter to his wife, a very
bulky epistle, dwelt upon their own difficulties. It was the first
letter he had written to her, and Charlotte&rsquo;s face, as she read
it, was a study.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first salute">&rdquo;<span class="sc">My dearest
Girl</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are that, after all. I&rsquo;ve been thinking over our
affairs, and I am willing to admit that I was hasty. But I don&rsquo;t
think that you treated me altogether fair. What I do see is that we
haven&rsquo;t got any time to jaw over what is done and gone. You have
been talking about leaving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>me and all that, but that is just
talk. I don&rsquo;t suppose you ever really meant it, and I never took
it seriously. We&rsquo;ll kiss and be friends when I get back, and
you&rsquo;ll see that everything will come out all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been having a pretty fine time up here. About the
first person I met was Barton. I had intended to kick him on sight, but
I was still feeling pretty sore toward you, so I didn&rsquo;t. He took
me up to his clubs and entered my name, and the next night took me to
call on that Mrs. Badgerly. Lord! Lord! that woman is inquisitive! She
dug at me like a lawyer at a witness. I never gave anything away: swore
you wouldn&rsquo;t come along because you hated the sea trip so, and
vowed I had come up on a sugar lorcha. Then this Mrs. Badgerly
(she&rsquo;s a corker; I like her style), told me she wanted to take me
to see old General &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s wife, because the old lady
knew you at home. She was a mighty nice old lady&mdash;real
motherly,&mdash;and she told me a lot of things that you never told me,
and made a good many things clear that I&rsquo;ve never understood.
Then I was invited out to the General&rsquo;s to a big dinner, where
there were two or three other people who used to know you; and if I
hadn&rsquo;t been so fond of you, it would have made me all-fired mad
the way they rammed it into me that I had married into a fine family,
and a fine woman, and all that sort of thing. I didn&rsquo;t need their
verdict on you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was another old lady there who used to know you [here
Martin named the mother of a very important civil officer], and both
the old ladies took me to their hearts and purred over me. I bluffed
the thing right through, invited <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294"
href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>everybody to Maylubi, and
promised to bring you up some time this year. Barton was at the dinner
too, and he piled it on thick about our island, made it quite
romantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the long and the short of the matter is that you call
me. I&rsquo;ll admit that the crowd here is a little swifter than any I
have ever known, and maybe you have some right to your private opinions
that I didn&rsquo;t see before. And, as you said, you keep them to
yourself, so I don&rsquo;t see why I should let them bother me.
I&rsquo;ll stay another month or so, and by that time we will both have
a chance to get over our grudges. You needn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
let you go back to nursing; and as for me, I am willing to live with
you on the old terms, and mighty anxious to get back to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have put six dots here to represent six kisses (......).
I&rsquo;ll give you sixty when I get home.</p>
<p class="signed">&ldquo;Your affectionate husband,</p>
<p class="signed">&rdquo;<span class="sc">Martin
Collingwood</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P. S. I am going to take both old ladies for a drive
to-night. How am I getting on for a beau?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When she had twice read this epistle, Mrs. Martin Collingwood was
startled by the realization of a great mental change in herself. For
six weeks she had schooled herself to feel that she must leave her
husband purely out of decent pride and self-respect. She had believed
that she was actuated by the desire to remove an obnoxious presence
from one who had ceased to take pleasure in it; and she had said to
herself a hundred times that her affection <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>for
her husband had never wavered, but that to thrust it upon him was
indecent.</p>
<p>But as she laid down the letter after a second perusal, she was
aghast to realize that she did not want to live again with Martin
Collingwood: that she recoiled passionately from his easy sense of
possession; that his taking her so completely for granted was an
affront that she could not pardon. She became conscious of a slow
process that had been going on in her mind during the dreary weeks, the
death of the feeling that had cast a glamour over Martin Collingwood
and his inability to understand her standards and traditions. He had
lived with her for a year, and had been unable to comprehend that she
was of different substance from Mrs. Maclaughlin or Mrs. Badgerly. He
had been grossly offensive at the bare suggestion that she might be
superior to one of them, but when she was ticketed with the
other&rsquo;s approval,&mdash;she drew an indignant breath,&mdash;he
stood ready to exhibit her to the world, and to call its attention to
the superfine partner whom he had drawn in the matrimonial lottery.</p>
<p>Well, he would be disappointed. He had yet to learn that she was no
readier to accept his terms <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=
"#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>than he had been to accept hers.
She had had her romance, and she would pay the price!</p>
<p>Her social knowledge told her, also, that the Spencer family had
taken steps to make its power felt across the Pacific, and that in
spite of her marriage and her bitter letter, they were behind her,
holding fast to the old tenet that blood is thicker than water. She
knew that from both the ladies who had impressed Martin as motherly old
dears she would have received at any time both courtesy and kindness;
but they would not have taken especial notice of Martin Collingwood or
have troubled themselves to introduce him without some sort of urgent
appeal from the Boston family.</p>
<p>The thought warmed her sad heart a little, for we are all grateful
for good-will, and the world looked a lonely place to Charlotte at that
time. She was very thoughtful, however, and she was inclined to regret
that old family friends had arrived so inopportunely in Manila. It
would make her lot harder, entail humiliating explanations exceedingly
difficult to make and&mdash;crowning agony&mdash;it would mean that the
disastrous outcome of her marriage would be immediately known and
discussed by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297"
name="pb297">297</a>]</span>very persons whose knowledge of her affairs
she most desired to restrict.</p>
<p>She was sitting on her veranda, the letter upon her lap, her brows
frowning, her lips pain-drawn, when Kingsnorth approached from his own
cottage. He too had had a letter from Collingwood, and after a bath and
a change of garments, had come over to discuss it with Mrs.
Collingwood.</p>
<p>He advanced with the hesitating and apologetic air which he had worn
with her ever since that unfortunate evening on the beach. She roused
herself to a cold courtesy, gave him a cup of tea, and then sat
listlessly awaiting what she knew he had come to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a letter from Martin,&rdquo; Kingsnorth began
awkwardly, at length, &ldquo;which I thought you might want to see. He
says in it that he did not mention some of the business details to you
and that I am to show it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took it, glanced through it, flushed slightly, but handed it
back without comment. It was a characteristically brief but condensed
epistle, dealing wholly with business save in the last paragraph.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Better show this to my wife. I wrote her, but
had something more interesting to talk about than these matters. You
were quite right. I have been a damn fool, but I am all right now, and
she and I are going to be happy ever after.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As Charlotte returned the epistle, Kingsnorth fixed her with a
curious eye, half interested, half apologetic. Then, as she said
nothing, he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be as Martin says, Mrs. Collingwood, and that
no lasting ill will come out of my stupidity and insistence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight flush tinged Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;Martin
wrote what he meant to be a kindly letter, and I am grateful for it.
But it really doesn&rsquo;t affect the matter in the least. I am going
away. You will have to know it sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t forgive him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forgive myself. I have no hard feeling against
him. But he showed me myself.&rdquo; Her face burned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Collingwood, don&rsquo;t feel that way. Martin did
not mean what he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her heavy eyes. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t; or, at least, the coloring he gave
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>it wasn&rsquo;t true. It wouldn&rsquo;t be true
unless&mdash;&rdquo; he paused and broke off confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know.&rdquo; He looked at her steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you leave him. That&rsquo;s what they do; that&rsquo;s
what I did when I got tired. But if you stay by what you promised, no
human being can think of you with less than respect. It isn&rsquo;t the
game, it&rsquo;s the way you play the game that counts.&rdquo; His
voice trembled with emotion.</p>
<p>Charlotte sat very still, her cheeks burning. It seemed
incomprehensible that she should be sitting there, listening to John
Kingsnorth&rsquo;s views on ethics. Where had she failed? What gradual
disintegration had taken place in her, that she should be willing, nay,
eager, to listen to moral advice from a man whose very presence had
once seemed polluting?</p>
<p>At the same time, she realized that his words had value. Is it, she
asked herself, the cut and dried opinion of those who walk safely along
a beaten path in company with myriads of their fellow beings, which
really counts in this world? or is it the knowledge that comes of
bitterness and experience? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href=
"#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>It is so easy to formulate
high-sounding phrases; but what do these phrases amount to when one is
confronted with life? In the past three years, what downward steps had
she taken upon that pathway&mdash;she whose whole ideal had been to
keep herself untainted from the common world and to walk serenely and
gracefully along those heights where all the training of childhood and
the instincts of heredity had made her believe that her path lay? When
had she missed it? And then, like a flash, she saw in retrospect her
conduct for years past; saw herself stopping here, twisting there,
trying, at every instant, to evade the fate and the suffering allotted
to her in life. Suddenly she realized how much she and John Kingsnorth
had in common, for each was a coward. Neither had strength to take
sorrow to his heart, and to bear it uncomplainingly. She was doing what
he had done, failing as he had failed.</p>
<p>The letter dropped from her shaking fingers, and she raised her eyes
to his with a look so hopeless, shamed, and grief-stricken, that he
shrank back and winced as if he had seen a gaping wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Something has snapped.
I have changed. I can&rsquo;t be Martin Collingwood&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>wife again. If the weight of my own
self-contempt could crush me, I should be dead. Oh, why did they
destroy my faith? There would have been the religious life at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not talk that way,&rdquo; Kingsnorth said.
&ldquo;Your path is as plain as a pikestaff. You married Martin
Collingwood,&mdash;why, only you and your Maker know,&mdash;but you did
marry him, and you have got to stay with him. He needs you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you men!&rdquo; she cried scornfully. &ldquo;And if he
did not need me&mdash;if only I needed him&mdash;it would be equally my
duty to leave him. However you arrange the scale of duties, they are
always to suit your own interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking of this from yours,&rdquo; Kingsnorth said
firmly. &ldquo;I tell you, and I know, that the one thing the human
soul can&rsquo;t stand is to live on compromising with its own
self-contempt. A woman of your brains can&rsquo;t take the liberties
with her conscience that her frivolous sisters do. You can&rsquo;t
stand the self-contempt. You&rsquo;ll disintegrate under it. Convince
yourself that you are a martyr if you can, and hug your martyrdom. They
got something out of it when it was boiling oil, and melted lead, and
crucifixion, and all the rest of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302"
href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>those horrors. Be a martyr if
you must, but do not try living under the weight of your own
self-contempt. Of all failures that is the weakest, saddest, most
loathsome. Dear lady, I&rsquo;ve carried mine with me like an
atmosphere. People have felt it; you did. I&rsquo;ve seen you shrink
from me as if I were a leper. And you were right. I am loathsome to
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, wiped his brow, and settled back into his chair with a
heavy sigh. Charlotte sat on, her trembling fingers tightly clasped,
her eyes fixed on the sea. She turned at last and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t take up that thread of life. I
don&rsquo;t know how I got myself here&mdash;it is all a
nightmare&mdash;but I must go away and work&mdash;by myself
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingsnorth leaned forward, his hands loosely clasped between his
knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you listen to the story of my life, Mrs.
Collingwood?&rdquo; he said with more of sharpness in his tone than was
characteristic of him.</p>
<p>Charlotte had little curiosity in anyone else&rsquo;s affairs; but
she would have listened to anything at that moment to slip away from
the discussion of her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href=
"#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>own. She nodded listlessly, and
Kingsnorth began speaking in a very judicial tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was what is called in England well born, though my people
were not rich. My father came of a very old and once distinguished
family, but was the owner of an impoverished estate. My mother was
equally well born, and possessed a small income of her own. You
probably know that, in England, the eldest son is the family; nobody
else really counts. In our family there were two girls, then my elder
brother, the &lsquo;heir,&rsquo; then myself, and another girl. I
cannot remember the time when the rest of us were not all being pinched
to keep things going for the heir. Tom was, on the whole, a pretty good
fellow, but that sort of rearing would spoil the best nature that was
ever born. He got into the way of thinking that the rest of us ought to
sacrifice everything we had or could hope to have to his position. He
was also a devilish good-looking fellow, easy-going and selfish, as was
natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My two elder sisters were promptly married off, on the whole
pretty well. The difficulty came with Tom. He had to marry money, and
he had not enough in himself or the place to make money come begging
for him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom was in an expensive regiment. My dream of life was also
the army, but the paternal pocketbook couldn&rsquo;t stand it, so I was
put in a bank instead. I promptly fell head-over-ears in love with the
banker&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her family was what we called &lsquo;new people&rsquo;; but
there was plenty of money, and if Elena wanted me, why she must have
me. Therefore no objections were made to the engagement. I was in the
seventh heaven of happiness. I do not deny that I was glad she had
plenty of money; but I should have married her just the same if she had
not had a cent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elena paid a visit to my home in the early days of our
betrothal, and&mdash;well, she threw me over deliberately for my elder
brother. Looking back now, I can see some excuse for her. I was
unimportant in my family, of course, and Tom was its centre. He looked
handsome in his uniform, and he was the heir. The place had age and
dignity, and she knew its value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give Tom the credit of being ashamed and of feeling some
remorse; but my father and mother planned&mdash;actually aided and
abetted my betrayal. They wanted the money for the heir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a row, naturally, but it was fruitless. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>Elena wept and declared that she would have her
own way. Tom looked ashamed, but his bringing up had made him
constitutionally selfish; and the parents on both sides joined to
suppress me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end was that I cleared out, blind with rage and pain,
cursing Elena and my kin; and in the next three years in London I went
to what is commonly known as the dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My self-pity is justifiable in my eyes to-day; but I made a
fatal mistake. If I had had the right stuff in me, Elena couldn&rsquo;t
have driven me to the dogs. I might have hugged my griefs and have
grown embittered; but my worst mistake was the desire to &lsquo;drown
sorrow&rsquo; with drink, with cards, with all the undesirable vices of
men. If I had hugged sorrow and warmed it to my heart, I might have
suffered more, but I should not have crumbled up morally like a gold
ring in quicksilver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;England has always a frontier war or two on her hands, and I
got into one. A private, a &lsquo;gentleman ranker&rsquo; has a
magnificent opportunity to sink in the English army. Afterwards I
drifted over here, and got into pearl-fishing. I liked the life and its
adventures (we had to fight a bit in the early days), and then when the
Americans came, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306"
name="pb306">306</a>]</span>I fell in with Collingwood. We fancied each
other on sight. Then we picked up Mac, and I lighted accidentally on
this oyster bed, and we settled here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout all these years I have kept up a desultory
correspondence with my married sisters; but I have drifted out of their
lives, and I realize that I represent to them only a possible legacy.
It is my business to make some money, and one day to die and leave it
to them; and meanwhile a few gifts from the Orient are not
unacceptable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to shorten this tale, I settled here and married my
wife. You need not look so startled. She was my wife legally; bell,
book, and candle were all there. I lived openly with her in my house
till the morning when you landed on Maylubi. Then, after I had seen and
talked with you, I went home and ordered her out. She loved me, and she
obeyed me. Five months later she died.&rdquo; He stopped and wiped a
cold perspiration from his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could you have kept it from me?&rdquo; cried
Charlotte. &ldquo;Why did not Martin or Mrs. Maclaughlin tell
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mac had her orders from Mac. She never disobeys him.
Martin was simply a good friend.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But he brought me here.&rdquo; She stopped, crimsoning with
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. He brought you here to associate with me, a
respectable married man, as he considered me. He has never understood
my conduct. He doesn&rsquo;t understand why I preferred you to believe
me a profligate instead of a decent married man. He has never
understood why I should be willing to have my child pass for
illegitimate. But you understand, Mrs. Collingwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand.&rdquo; Then with sudden passion she cried,
&ldquo;But it was not my fault. I was trained to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was. But, if I had had one spark of manhood in me, I
should have stood by the woman I had married, and should have taken my
child to my heart in the face of the world. But I did not have the
courage. I writhed and twisted to get out of facing the consequences of
my own actions; and since then the weight of my own self-contempt has
grown steadily heavier. Don&rsquo;t talk to me of reform,&rdquo; he
added savagely as she started to speak. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any
reform for such as I. I tell you the consciousness of my own moral
cowardice is with me day and night. It never leaves me. And
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>it&rsquo;s the ungodly unfairness of it all that
kills me by inches. I see other men about me, living lives not so very
different from mine: Collingwood himself has been no saint. But because
I&rsquo;ve wanted better things, because I drank my cup, knowing that
it was poor drink, it has not slaked my thirst, and it has parched the
last drop of sweetness out of my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go another foot along this trail; you began
it when you married Collingwood. If you double and twist on your tracks
again, you are lost. Hug pain, hug misery, martyr yourself, if you
will, but don&rsquo;t try to indulge your own selfish will, and to
square things by saying that you despise yourself. God in Heaven! Do
you know what it is to despise yourself? You don&rsquo;t now; but you
will some day.&rdquo; He wiped the perspiration that stood in great
drops on his brow.</p>
<p>Charlotte, who had turned very white, sat nerveless and trembling
like a leaf. All her pride was in arms that John Kingsnorth, degraded
scion of a decent family, should be giving advice to her; and then she
saw, with sudden horror, what a tremendous distance she had drifted
with the current before John Kingsnorth&rsquo;s words could be true.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p>For they were true! She had married Martin Collingwood, blaming
herself for the weakness that made human affection and the freedom from
the responsibility of self-support loom larger than all the traditions
of birth and breeding. She had wanted her romance as every other woman
in the world does; and romance, as it comes to most women, had been
denied her. She might have gone out and found one, as many a woman
does, and might, in time, have taken her flirtations lightly. But she
had been too timid and too proud to flirt. The doubt came to her that
it would have been better to play lightly at romance than to purchase
it at the sacrifice of the second essential factor that makes a true
marriage. Then came another throb of terror. She saw herself bent
wilfully again on her own way, doubling, twisting, as Kingsnorth
phrased it, trying to escape her conscience by saying that she despised
herself: but the fact stared her in the face that she was turning on
all the principles that had justified romance. She had married
Collingwood against her reason, justifying herself for being swayed by
human feeling by reiterating the finality of the action. For better,
for worse, she had said&mdash;but now that it was for worse, its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>finality had somehow disappeared. Where was her
mind&mdash;her will&mdash;her conscience?</p>
<p>She sat for a long time in bitter silence, but roused herself as
Kingsnorth, who had been furtively watching her, drew out his tobacco
pouch and extracted from its depths a little ball of tissue paper. He
unfolded it, and there appeared to her startled eyes a single pearl of
unusual size and luster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beauty!&rdquo; she cried, bending forward to look at
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s beautiful enough,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve carried it about with me for three years. Even
Collingwood has never seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had not&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped, flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t show it to you to tempt you. It&rsquo;s my
moral slough. There are times when I&rsquo;ve felt that its hell luster
was my soul, and that I had nothing but the blackened shell in my body.
It stood for the dearest emotions a man can have&mdash;for love and
vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are horrible,&rdquo; she cried, shrinking from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am better than I used to be,&rdquo; replied Kingsnorth.
&ldquo;I found this bauble three years ago, before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>Martin and I went into business. I never
intended to sell it. Do you know what I wanted it for? To buy her back,
and to blacken the face of the man who stole her from me. Yes, shrink!
God help me, I love that woman still with a love gone awry. Other
women, yes, and better women, though they had not her grace and
training, have loved me; but, in my heart of hearts, I have held them
all cheap. It was she, the woman who jilted me before all the world,
that I wanted. It was he, whose heart I wanted to wring. Poor cheap
human nature! Twelve years I&rsquo;ve roughed it in shacks and junks, a
flannel shirt to my back, and pork and beans or rice and fish in my
stomach; while he has sat beneath the oaks we played under in our
childhood, and has slept in the panelled rooms of our home, and has
held the woman he stole from me in his arms! Talk of family affection!
There isn&rsquo;t such a thing. What am I to the mother who bore me? A
derelict son, adrift in the South Seas, who is not to come home without
some money. What am I to the sisters who played with me and fought with
me over our nursery tea? A scape-grace brother, who, it is hoped, will
keep out of the way, but who ought to make some money and leave
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>it to their children. Money! I&rsquo;ve toiled
like a negro slave for money, but not for them&mdash;not for them! It
was for her. I wanted to go back rich. She sold herself once; why not
again? The pearl was not enough in itself to tempt. It was the bauble,
the outward sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hoped&mdash;that?&rdquo; She could not help glancing at
his seamed, degenerate countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never after you came. The look in your eyes told me what I
had become. Since then I have lived&mdash;with myself.&rdquo; He smiled
a wretched, drawn smile.</p>
<p>She pointed gingerly to the bauble. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get
rid of it? sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell my soul? Did I not tell you my soul is steeped in it?
No, bury it with me. Somehow I know I&rsquo;ll not last long. Take this
word from me. If you know anything of me when death comes, see that
this does not go to the women who betrayed me and pitied me not. Women
are selfish creatures. They sun themselves on their own cat premises.
They have no pity for the poor devils on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it women alone? or isn&rsquo;t it men as well, who are
pitiless? Or isn&rsquo;t it just life? Yet it isn&rsquo;t <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>pitiless to all. There are those who dance
through it on rose-strewn paths.&rdquo; She stopped, the sense of the
great differences in individual lives overwhelming her.</p>
<p>Kingsnorth rose. &ldquo;Well, that hasn&rsquo;t been my life or
yours. I have seen that you suffer. But suffer! Don&rsquo;t change that
look on your face. Better poignant suffering than moral decay. I tell
you, you are facing it.&rdquo; He rose abruptly and walked away,
leaving her like a figure carved in ivory, looking out on the waste of
waters, that seemed the emblem of waste in her own life. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the month that elapsed between her conversation
with Kingsnorth and the time set by Collingwood for his return,
Charlotte had time for an exhausting and (as it seemed to her)
fruitless self-inquisition. She was alternately the prey of a hopeless
apathy and of a consuming impatience, but in either mood there ran a
strong undercurrent of rebellion against all the formative influences
of her life. At times the future yawned before her like a bottomless
gulf, into the darkness and loneliness of which she must inevitably
sink helpless. Out of love as she was with her husband, the prospect of
going back to her forlorn, loveless state was one she could not
contemplate. To get up day after day, knowing that there was, in all
this world, no human being who took more than a casual interest in her;
to go to bed at night, knowing that, if ruin and disaster overtook the
world, no human thought would turn to her, no voice cry to hers out of
the darkness, no warm human <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href=
"#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>hand reach for hers, seemed to her
a fate infinitely worse than death. Yet she had lived just that life
for twenty-eight years before she married Martin Collingwood to escape
from it; and, though she had been most unhappy in it, she certainly had
not regarded it as a tragedy. She remembered once having seen a young
soldier come forth from the court-room after he had received a life
sentence for shooting his corporal. The boy had lifted his hat with his
manacled hands and had raised a white face to the touch of the cool
morning wind. Something in the gesture had expressed his sense of
helplessness in the grasp of that terrible thing we call the law. He
was looking down the long vista of years at a living death ten thousand
times worse than death, at a life from which every human ambition,
every hope, every natural spring had been erased. His brother had
followed behind him, a short distance of twenty or thirty feet, already
the emblem of a separation that was to become complete. The brother was
weeping as strong men do when their hearts are wrung; but, as she had
looked at them, one so quiet, the other convulsed with grief, she had
recognized that, to the second man, life held comfort and healing
still. In the long years to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href=
"#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>come, new interests would take the
place of the old tie; a wife and babes would fill that life; healthy
toil allied to honorable ambition would make the years seem to fly; and
the memory of a convict brother would drop out of life, only to be
recalled tenderly at those seasons when a universal festival brings
back the old days and makes the rotting thread of memory seem new and
strong once more. But what of the other? Nothing new would come to him,
nothing to strive for, nothing to look forward to, nothing to live upon
but memories that would be very, very bitter. There would be toil and
food and rest, and renewed toil, and the awful knowledge that long
before he ceased to live he had ceased to be even to those who had been
his nearest and dearest.</p>
<p>Well, she had lived it once. She could live it again. As with the
soldier there would be toil and food and rest, and renewed toil. But
the heart cries loudly for more than these things in life, until that
heart is chastened into meekness. Would she ever be meek, she wondered
sadly. If she could have accepted her fate with submission and sadness
only, she would have felt herself indeed treated with mercy by the
unseen fates. But there was no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317"
href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>element of submission in her
mood. As often as she contemplated the future, and said to herself that
these things must be, had to be, so often the wild will rose within her
to say that they must not be. She lay often for hours at a time face
downward on her bed, not a muscle moving, not a sound escaping her
tense lips; but her passivity was the physical expression of an
impotence that left her prostrate before the overwhelming fates.</p>
<p>Often there recurred to her mind a conversation which had taken
place between her and a fellow nurse, a young, joyous, magnetic
creature for whom she had formed a friendship more nearly approximating
intimacy than any other that had come into her life. It was in the last
days of her engagement, and she had spoken of a fear of what
unhappiness love might bring into her life. The other had looked at her
with amazement. &ldquo;Love!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can imagine it
bringing a lot of joy, but why unhappiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why unhappiness?&rdquo; Charlotte asked in vain for the
reason; but the fact stood stronger than any &ldquo;why&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
that there had been, in all her life, some fundamental outrage of human
sentiment. It had existed in that strange paternal attitude of her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>father&rsquo;s; it had lived on in that
perfunctory kindness of the nuns who had found her an antipathetic and
incomprehensible child; and it had grown and intensified in the
curious, prying interest developed in those who had governed her later
years. That any such a condition could exist by a series of fortuitous
events was out of the question. There had to be cause running through
it all. Yet search her heart and mind as she would, she found there no
wells of bitterness or evil thought or envy or malice to justify
relations so peculiar as had finally established themselves between her
and human society.</p>
<p>The solution of the question came to her suddenly, when, on a
particularly dreary day, she had been trying to discipline herself and
to keep her thoughts from running on her own troubles. She had spent
two hours trying to read the story, written by a great modern author,
of three precocious school-boys. She had been a great admirer of the
author, and, up to that time, had found fascination in his pages; but
the three boys were little to her taste. As she mused sadly, a flash of
insight came, and another; and, little by little, she saw clearly what
had so long puzzled her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href=
"#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>The precocious child is abnormal, and inspires in his fellow men
that blind instinct to worry and torment which runs all through the
animal world. She had been a precocious child, made uncanny by
perceptions of the hidden currents and causes of life at a time when
she should have been gurgling over its toys. As she recalled her
sensitiveness to impressions, her powers of reading what was passing in
others&rsquo; minds, and the singular growth of self-concealment and
self-control that had grown out of them, it seemed to her that her keen
brain had been her lifelong curse. Little by little, she went back to
her convent days and tried to put herself in the place of the good
sisters who had taught her. How distressing it must have been to them
to feel the dumb interrogation that was always so strong under outward
obedience! If she could have been unconscious of her father&rsquo;s
mental state and could have made a happy child&rsquo;s claim upon his
affections, would he not in time have come to love her? If, when she
was a lonely orphan, living on her cousin&rsquo;s sufferance, she had
been able to reveal to her relatives the suffering that she really
underwent in the strange ostracism which she had built up for herself,
would not pity have conquered their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>selfishness? She drew
a long, pained sigh, as she thought of what a difference might have
been made in her life by a little less brain and a little more moral
courage.</p>
<p>She was lying in her steamer chair on the veranda of her house at
the time; and by her side, on a taboret, stood a glass of water. She
picked it up and smiled over it. It was full of microbes (dead, of
course, for Americans drink no unboiled water in the Philippines), and
she knew it, and cared little, for she could not see them. But had she
possessed an eye with the magnifying power of a strong microscope, she
could not have tasted the water for the sight of the dead organisms
would have made it unpalatable. She began to wonder what would be the
effect on society, if there were let loose upon it a body of persons
with microscopic eyes. They would shrink and exclaim and turn faint at
dishes that the epicure delights in. How they would upset dinners and
spoil little suppers and picnic luncheons! How eagerly would their
society be avoided, and how soon their name become anathema!</p>
<p>But though physically the microscopic eye does not yet exist, the
mental and spiritual microscopic eye does exist, and it has about the
same distressing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321"
name="pb321">321</a>]</span>effect upon its human brethren who do not
possess it as the other sort might have. She had had the microscopic
eye&mdash;nothing could blind her to facts&mdash;and her starts and
shrinkings had made her antipathetic to most of the persons with whom
she had come in contact. It had remained for Martin, the indomitably
ignorant, to be blind to her mental attitude, to assume her a normal
woman of the world in which he found her. What of gratitude did she not
owe him?</p>
<p>The thought pricked her to her feet, set her to restless pacings of
the floor. Whatever of gratitude she owed him, she was preparing
ingratitude in the course she was still bent upon pursuing. Never had
she appreciated the stubborn inheritance of her own will till she
measured herself against it in this struggle. Whatever the conscience
and the intelligence might say, her will said &ldquo;No&rdquo; as often
as she contemplated forgiving Martin and going back to her life with
him. The feeling which had been warm in her heart for him so long was
dead&mdash;killed by his own brutal words, buried in her own shame and
self-reproach. She saw with unutterable sadness, that there was no hope
of its resuscitation. But did that break the tie that she had of her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>own volition forged? Could not that same will of
hers which resisted so bitterly be schooled to duty and to right? For
against a year&rsquo;s tenderness and kindness, where was the justice
of weighing the utterances of a single hour of pain and disappointment?
The one ought not to balance the other. She had no right to think so
for an instant. Alas, though, one did balance the other, outweighed it
many times!</p>
<p>Her marriage had been all wrong. But had she been less conscious of
the fact on the day she married him than on the day when she vainly
struggled to convince herself that she ought to go on living with him?
Marriage can not be for love alone any more than it can be for selfish
material interest alone. In its appeal to human emotion and in its
relation to the family it may be, as the church calls it, a sacrament;
but marriage as a lifelong partnership must have its material side.
Love must enter in; but no healthy marriage can exist, unless there be
equally the consciousness of a good bargain, of a legitimate exchange
of values, added to the affection which sanctifies it. Well,
Collingwood had played fairly. It was she who had entered into the
alliance, knowing its weakness, knowing herself. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>But did she know herself? What more that was disappointing and
agonizing was she to learn of herself? What was even then struggling in
her breast? Was there some secret hope holding itself in concealment
behind her oft repeated thought that life was ended for her? Did some
hidden ambition prompt her to take the step that she believed came from
self-respect? She had learned only too well her capacity for
self-deception. She had advanced step by step along the path by which
she had come to the church door with Martin Collingwood, denying every
motive which, in the end, had proved itself the stronger. Was it
possible that she was turning blindly, as women naturally turn, to a
second man to lift her from the wreck to which she had brought her life
with the first? Again she faced that truth which she had long before
discovered, that too passionate a denial constitutes an assertion; and
while every atom of her intelligence bade her distrust her own
sophistry, every throb of a strong emotional nature bade her turn from
the conclusions of her reason.</p>
<p>In these hours of agonizing inquisition when her soul seemed
literally torn in two, she contemplated with added despair, the loss of
her early religious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324"
name="pb324">324</a>]</span>faith. It did not come back to her in the
least. No impulse for prayer seized her. The conviction that the world
is made up of blind forces, and that there is no help outside of
ourselves was very strong in her. She might pray and pray, but when she
arose from her knees, the elements of struggle would be there still,
tearing at her, filling her soul with pain. Prayer would not bring
sleep to her aching eyeballs in the night, it would not silence the cry
in her heart, it would not keep the thronging thoughts from her weary
brain. Time alone could do that. Give her time&mdash;she smiled
bitterly&mdash;and change of circumstances, and she might put the
experiences of the last three years behind her, put even the man who
had ruled her life and thought for a year (and a happy year) behind
her.</p>
<p>Of course she wrestled with the temptations which must present
themselves to the intelligent mind which has had the ways of the world
set before it. Intelligence said that nothing mattered except the
material. She could be good or bad, noble or contemptible, so long as
she played her game well and kept on good terms with that thing we call
the world. Little the world cares what we do or what we are, said
intelligence; the question with it is how <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>much power do we own
in this vale of tears. Intelligence told her that with the backing of
her family and the successful use of her own powers, and with Judge
Barton&rsquo;s political influence, they two might make a very
comfortable place for themselves in this material universe. She felt
dangerously sure of the Judge. The knowledge had come to her (how she
knew not) that all she needed to insure her an absolute dominion over
the man&rsquo;s soul was a little less moral fastidiousness, a little
more worldliness. Indeed, a strange confidence in her own powers of
attraction was working itself out of all the miserable situation. She
realized how completely she had under-estimated her own charm. Less
conscience, less good taste, more charity (which is a much misused term
in these days, signifying lack of all social and moral tradition), in
fact, a general elimination of the best qualities of her nature would
constitute a humanizing process which would work decidedly to her
material advantage. But she was not willing to submit herself to the
process. She wanted her own way, and she wanted to remain her ideal
self. More and more clearly she saw the unreasonableness of her demand.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the days slipped by one by one, and she marked them off on her
calendar. In the end, the time for the launch to go up to Romblon
arrived without her having taken any decisive steps toward the act
which she still declared to herself she was bent upon. She excused
herself on the ground of Martin&rsquo;s letter, saying to herself that
she owed him a personal interview and explanation for her refusal to
accept his offer of reconciliation. But in truth, she was pulling away
again from the uncomfortable. She could contemplate the action, but
until circumstances more disagreeable than those she was enduring
forced her into activity, she would not take a decisive step.</p>
<p>It had been the original intention that Kingsnorth should take the
launch over for Collingwood, but, as the time slipped by, and the
typhoon season was at hand this idea was deemed impracticable.
Maclaughlin was a licensed engineer, while Kingsnorth was not, and the
launch was not in the best of repair.</p>
<p>Maclaughlin left at daybreak on an exceedingly hot morning, when the
sea rolled lazily in long, metallic swells shining as if the brilliant
surface <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>were oiled. All that day the heat was like a
vapor, but in mid-afternoon the clouds rolled up, showers fell at
intervals, and cool gusts of wind made the cocoanut trees writhe and
their stiff leaves to rattle. Once or twice Charlotte looked at the
barometer, which fell steadily.</p>
<p>At dinner their common anxiety made the three more companionable
than anyone had hoped to be. &ldquo;We are going to have a
<i>baguio</i>, that&rsquo;s flat,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth, &ldquo;but it
has been kind in holding off. Mac&rsquo;s safe in Romblon harbor by
this time, and that is landlocked, and shut in by mountains. If
Collingwood is there, they&rsquo;ll wait anyway to come out.
Mac&rsquo;s got sense enough not to leave port on a falling barometer,
though Collingwood might take the chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Martin isn&rsquo;t out on the ocean to-night,&rdquo;
said Charlotte. &ldquo;It makes me ill to think of it.&rdquo; She
shivered and glanced into the darkness where the oily surf fell over in
ghostly green fire, and the wash rolled back pricked with millions of
vanishing light points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spooky, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; remarked Kingsnorth. He set
down his coffee-cup (they were just finishing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>dinner), and as his hostess rose, held back the
rattling shell curtain for her, then went to inspect the barometer. He
whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just so-so.&rdquo; Something in his tone betrayed an
effort to retrieve the impression made by his bit of carelessness. Mrs.
Maclaughlin went over to the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly 750,&rdquo; she said in a dismayed
tone.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3140src" href="#xd20e3140" name=
"xd20e3140src">1</a> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known it to go that low
without warning since I&rsquo;ve lived on the island. I wish Mac and
Martin were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte said nothing, but in her heart she echoed the
other&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; replied Kingsnorth, curtly.
&ldquo;I hope that you will not feel it presumptuous in me to suggest
that Mrs. Maclaughlin stay with you to-night, Mrs. Collingwood.
I&rsquo;ll come over also if there is anything very bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both women were grateful for the suggestion. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>Each
had been secretly longing to broach the matter, and had felt ashamed to
do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over with you while you lock up your
place,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth to Mrs. Maclaughlin. They disappeared
almost instantly in the profound blackness of the night. Charlotte
marvelled at it. The gloom was like a solid substance save where the
phosphorescence showed a glimpse of foaming suds, and a few lights
gleaming from the distant village seemed golden by contrast with the
green and blue fires.</p>
<p>The servants all begged leave to absent themselves for the night.
Each had discovered an ailing relative in the village to whom his
presence was an absolute necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &lsquo;em go,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth. &ldquo;They are in
a dead fright. They know we&rsquo;ll probably have Tophet before the
night is over, and they want to get into their flock.&rdquo; Even as he
spoke, a little moan of wind came off the sea, and a pattering shower
drenched the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curtain rung up,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth. He had been standing
tentatively, hat in hand, after escorting back Mrs. Maclaughlin and
some, as it seemed to Charlotte, preposterously large bundles.
Charlotte <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>motioned him to a chair. &ldquo;We may as well
watch the first act,&rdquo; she smiled, humoring his metaphor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;because I fancy
we&rsquo;ll be on the second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that there may be any actual danger?&rdquo;
Charlotte asked, startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger? no! At the worst we might have to spend a night under
the pandan bushes. But one of these big storms is a trying thing while
it lasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Trying</i> isn&rsquo;t the word,&rdquo; Mrs. Maclaughlin
precipitated this dictum into the conversation with her usual vigor.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just nerve-wracking. Lord! Lord! what fools we women
are! Here are two of us out here likely to be swallowed up by a tidal
wave or Heaven only knows what, just because we were so tarnation ready
to take up with a man. I&rsquo;ve traipsed around this world at Andrew
Maclaughlin&rsquo;s heels twenty-two years, and the good Lord only
knows what he hasn&rsquo;t asked me to go through with; and now
he&rsquo;s left me unprotected in the face of the biggest storm
we&rsquo;re likely to have.&rdquo; She fairly choked with fear and
anger.</p>
<p>Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s untrammelled speech was at all times an
affront to Kingsnorth. The intimation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>that he was a poor
substitute for Maclaughlin as a protector stung him. When he spoke, his
voice had a quality of suave ugliness that grated like a rasped saw on
Charlotte&rsquo;s nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re panicky,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you pattern on Mrs. Collingwood and me? We&rsquo;re ready for anything;
are we not, dear lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heavy gust of wind and another downpour silenced them all for a
few seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth to Charlotte, as the gust
subsided, &ldquo;is just preliminary to the theme; it&rsquo;s the scale
playing in the key with which the virtuoso dazzles his audience before
he rolls up his cuffs, runs both hands through his hair, and gets into
the first movement. Ah, here&rsquo;s the theme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a virtuoso?&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Maclaughlin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A virtuoso is a gentleman who can play the piano or some
other instrument exceedingly well,&rdquo; Kingsnorth replied, with the
same dangerous suavity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate the nasty long-haired things.&rdquo; It was quite
evident that Mrs. Mac&rsquo;s nerves had gone to splinters. Charlotte
threw herself into the breach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t hate this storm,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;even if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>Mr. Kingsnorth did compare it to a sonata.
It&rsquo;s beautiful. It&rsquo;s grand.&rdquo; Another howl and
downpour, and this time the framework of the house shivered under its
impact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely the <i>andante</i>,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth, shrugging
his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make my blood run cold,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Maclaughlin.</p>
<p>It was too dark to see him, but Charlotte knew that his lips were
apart and his teeth grinning in an evil smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, Mrs. Maclaughlin?&rdquo; said Charlotte suddenly.
&ldquo;If danger is coming, it will come. No human power can stop it.
The future is as unreadable as the very sky. But why borrow trouble for
what we are powerless to resist? And if there is beauty and majesty in
all this conflict of the elements, surely it is better to see that,
than to sit dreading the unknown. Mr. Kingsnorth&rsquo;s comparisons
are not unjust. It is like a great piece of music, divided into
movements. Whatever it may come to later, it is glorious
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a brave woman,&rdquo; Kingsnorth cried.
&ldquo;Let loose the dogs of war and make Rome howl! Well, we
don&rsquo;t care; do we, Mrs. Collingwood?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Charlotte assented, though somewhat coldly.
Her manner brought him to a sudden check.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgot what?&rdquo; This point blank query about a remark not
addressed to herself emanated from Mrs. Maclaughlin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Mac,&rdquo; Kingsnorth said, and Charlotte winced
at his tone, &ldquo;you do not realize how quickly you deteriorate once
out of reach of Mac&rsquo;s disciplining eye. Mac would never have
permitted you to ask that question. I often wonder if, had it been my
good fortune to marry, I should have been able to exert the strong
guiding influence over my wife that Mac evidently holds over
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Mac, while Charlotte sat in
helpless embarrassment at the scene. &ldquo;Well, let me tell you that
you wouldn&rsquo;t have. You might have broken her heart, the Lord
knows, as you&rsquo;d probably have broken your children&rsquo;s
spirits, if you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; had &rsquo;em; but no woman
would ever be proud to be ruled by you as I&rsquo;m proud to be ruled
by Mac. I&rsquo;m disciplined. You hit the nail on the head there. And
maybe I fall back when Mac isn&rsquo;t around. But I love that old man
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>of mine. I&rsquo;ve followed him over deserts
and oceans. I may have let my mind go once in a while; but no woman on
God&rsquo;s green earth would have married you and lived with you
twenty-two years, and still have loved you as I love Mac. I&rsquo;ve
been rebellious sometimes with the Almighty, and it hasn&rsquo;t always
seemed as if the powers above knew what they were about. But the good
Lord did a wise thing when He kept women and children out of your
hands, John Kingsnorth.&rdquo; She arose with a snort of wrath and
passed into the house. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my Bible?&rdquo; they heard
her saying to herself. &ldquo;I brought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second or two, Charlotte remained like Kingsnorth, half
paralyzed by the outburst. Then a helpless, pitying embarrassment
settled upon her. It was all so terribly true, it was such a baring of
naked underfeelings. Would it ever be possible, she wondered, to resume
the island life after such an indecent exposure of what simmered deep
in Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s heart? Then, as the silence grew, she cast
about vainly for some change of subject. As if divining her thoughts,
Kingsnorth rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already the tempest has broken,&rdquo; he said. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been brewing three years. I
can&rsquo;t complain; and I know you think she told the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden impulse stirred Charlotte. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You must not think that. I believe that, if you had married the
right woman (that&rsquo;s the stock phrase, isn&rsquo;t it?) you would
have been a tender husband, and if you had had children, a kind father.
I don&rsquo;t know what perversity of fate kept those influences out of
your life, but all that is wayward in you and bitter seems to have been
caused by their lack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She uttered the words with real warmth, and for an instant wondered
that he made no reply. Then, as the pause grew more marked, she heard
him breathing heavily, and it flashed into her mind that the man was on
the point of an utter breakdown. Her few sincere words had gone
straight through the armor that Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s blows had
apparently failed to affect. An absolute horror of such a possibility
seized upon her. They had had, she felt, an indecent exhibition of
naked human emotions. If more were to follow, what intimate revelations
might not take place? Yet the impossibility of uttering some banality
was clear to her mind. Anything short of the sincerity and earnestness
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>demanded by the situation would be insulting. So
she remained as if transfixed, in a kind of shivering expectation of
what might be coming.</p>
<p>Kingsnorth, however, pulled himself together after a convulsive
movement or two of his chest. He stood for an instant without a word,
and then walked away to his own quarters, whence Charlotte soon heard
his voice shouting angrily for his servant.</p>
<p>Mrs. Maclaughlin, somewhat appeased by finding the Bible which she
had brought along for her usual nightly chapter, came out on the piazza
as the strident tones of Kingsnorth penetrated the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking it out on his boy,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;ve been aching to tell the truth to John Kingsnorth for two
years, and now I&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel any better for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no. I&rsquo;m always sorry when I blurt out.
He&rsquo;s right: Mac holds me in.&rdquo; Her voice broke. &ldquo;Oh,
my Lord! My Lord! I wish I knew where he was this minute. You&rsquo;re
a strange woman, Charlotte Collingwood. You sit here and watch them
waves roll in and hear the wind blowing, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>you
don&rsquo;t seem to give one thought to the man that you&rsquo;ve lived
here with side by side for a year. Ain&rsquo;t you got no love for
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte put up a hand. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t discuss that with you,
Mrs. Maclaughlin. Surely I have made it plain before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a lot plain,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Maclaughlin. There was endless reservation in her tone. It heaped such
mountains of unuttered reproach that Charlotte quite bowed under
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain is coming in strong,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maclaughlin,
when she had extracted sufficient healing from her companion&rsquo;s
discomfort. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get drenched out here. I&rsquo;m going
to read my Bible. You had better come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Charlotte motioned her away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not religiously
inclined to-night,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte Collingwood, do you defy your Maker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rebellious to-night, Mrs. Maclaughlin. There are
His waves and His winds, but still I&rsquo;m rebellious. I&rsquo;m not
apologetic to-night, not even in the face of a
<i>baguio</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak for you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maclaughlin
earnestly. She went inside, closed the doors and shell <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>windows to keep out the storm, and Charlotte
heard her keeping her word. Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s prayers were
simple but fervent. They seemed to consist chiefly of a few reiterated
sentences. &ldquo;O Lord, protect and save my old husband. You know I
love him, Lord; but it isn&rsquo;t all selfishness. O God, give me back
my Mac.&rdquo; At times she asked that the Divine Power might soften
the hardened heart of Mrs. Collingwood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Barometric pressure in Philippines is measured in millimeters. In
typhoons where fifth signal is flown, about 742 is lowest pressure
recorded. In great storm of 1908, 739.8 was lowest. Generally the
falling of the barometer is gradual for several days during the
continuance of the storm. When it falls suddenly, as here indicated,
before a storm, it means that a storm of short duration but of terrific
violence is coming.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Meanwhile, the object of her solicitation sat on in a
mood terribly blended of recklessness and despair. No shadow of fear
darkened the almost ecstatic rebellion of her mood. As the tempest
gathered force, and gusts of savage violence hurtled themselves out of
the crashing void in front, the rain was driven like fine shot before
them. In the lulls the great organ of the surf filled the starless
night with crashing harmonies, and through sound or silence a snow
field of tumbling froth showed a spectral glimmering through the inky
gloom. A crimson glow came through the transparencies of
Kingsnorth&rsquo;s shell windows, a touch of warmth in the blinding
convulsion of nature. In the distant Filipino village no lights showed;
and it was only after a considerable time that Charlotte became aware
that she missed them, and missed seeing, too, the riding lights of the
launch, which, on cloudy night or clear, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>had shone out
brightly against the dark outline of the hills above the cove.</p>
<p>For three hours she remained in the storm, drenched, her wet hair
torn down by the blasts; her being full of tumultuous welcome to the
mad elements that seemed to threaten her. They were so harmonious with
her sense of desolation, of failure, of wrecked effort, that for a time
it hardly occurred to her that they could mean other than destruction.
She pictured herself hurled about in the seething waste before her; but
no thrill of fear entered her heart. She almost yearned for the
struggle, the helpless physical effort, the very pain of dissolution.
The house rocked under the blows of the wind, but she hardly noticed
them. She was joyfully expectant of the blow that should shatter and
end all, and should take forever from her the agony of deciding between
two evils. She rose and, grasping the rails of the piazza, tried to
breast the full force of the wind and shot driven rain, but it drove
her back, and knocked her flat upon the veranda floor.</p>
<p>She must have been slightly stunned by knocking her head against a
chair, for she was next conscious of blurred thoughts, of a spent,
chill body <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>and of great mental and physical lassitude. Her
mood of elation had departed. She was confused, fearful of the crashing
thunder of surf and storm. In a lull, she dragged herself to her feet
and opened the door of her house.</p>
<p>The room, with its touches of refinement and beauty, looked
hospitable and attractive in spite of the fact that it was dripping
where great torn patches in the thatched roof let in the torrent. Mrs.
Mac knelt by the table, her eyes fixed, her lips moving. She uttered
the one phrase over and over in a heart-broken tone, &ldquo;O God, keep
my old man. God take care of my Mac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte, a wild, torn, drenched figure, stood contemplating her
for a moment, half in contempt; then, as the burden of the
other&rsquo;s cry pierced her brain, a sudden wave of pity and
affection swept aside the egoistic defiance of her mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin,&rdquo; she said softly, and each word came like the
musical utterance of grief. &ldquo;O Martin!&rdquo; She turned again
toward the sea and its howling terrors just as a gust blew out the
lamp. &ldquo;O my husband! O Martin!&rdquo; The sea which had been a
welcome enemy, a thing to fling defiance to and to yield to in one last
bout of struggle, seemed suddenly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342"
href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>an abyss of untold horrors;
was that thing which would not destroy her, but which might destroy
him. She stood motionless, with parted lips, staring into the
blackness. Behind her a ship&rsquo;s lantern, lighted earlier by Mrs.
Maclaughlin in anticipation of the fact that sooner or later the wind
would put out the lamp, revealed dimly the room and Mrs.
Maclaughlin&rsquo;s kneeling figure, with its plain tear-worn face, so
fervently uplifted. But she saw neither room nor figure. Her mind
leaped into the waste and pictured Martin all alone in the little white
and gold dining-room of the coastguard steamer. She saw the heaving
panelled walls, heard the hum of the electric light motor and the
pounding of the engines, felt the staggering impact of waves, and heard
the wash of the water as it swept astern. Martin&rsquo;s face was white
and set. He sat by the table in one of the swivel chairs, and she could
see his eyes fixed on the tassels of the little green silk curtains at
the stern windows. He was thinking of her. Something told her that no
thought of his own danger had ever occurred to him; that, in that
crucial hour, he could feel only for her facing the tempest alone in
their home. His larger unselfishness made itself felt. And for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>three hours she had been thinking of herself,
playing at melodrama, and mouthing heroic quotations, coquetting on dry
land with a tempest while the man she had loved was actually in its
grasp on the sea! Unutterable self-contempt seized upon her.</p>
<p>She turned and met Mrs. Maclaughlin&rsquo;s gaze. That lady had
risen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sane?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a
mad woman. I&rsquo;ve tried three times to drag you inside, You
didn&rsquo;t seem awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake now, Mrs. Maclaughlin. I&rsquo;ve been mad,
but I&rsquo;m sane. My poor, poor Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Maclaughlin, though a woman of prayer, was practical.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re drenched,&rdquo; she said. She made Charlotte
change into dry, warm clothing. Still the storm waxed violent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out of this,&rdquo; Mrs. Maclaughlin
said. &ldquo;Get your mackintosh and Martin&rsquo;s pistols. I&rsquo;ve
put up a basket of food&mdash;enough for two or three days. The house
has got to go.&rdquo; Indeed, it swayed perilously as they talked.</p>
<p>It was indeed strange to be belting on pistols and ammunition belts
at that hour of the night; but Charlotte saw that the older woman had
her wits <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>about her. In a few minutes the two were ready
to sally forth. Charlotte looked back with a sob. &ldquo;My dear little
home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been happy here&mdash;the only
happy moments of my life have been passed here.&rdquo; Mrs. Maclaughlin
said nothing.</p>
<p>The wind lulled for a moment as they stepped outside. The glow of
Kingsnorth&rsquo;s light brought recollection back to Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why hasn&rsquo;t Mr. Kingsnorth come to us?&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;He promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mac lifted an accusing finger. &ldquo;He promised,&rdquo; she
said bitterly. &ldquo;What do a boozer&rsquo;s promises amount to?
He&rsquo;s there now sodden with drink&mdash;not Christian drink, but
them French <i>liqueurs</i>. And our men that ought to be here, God
help &lsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind came back at that moment so violently that it knocked them
over. They lay gasping on their faces, but they heard the roar of
falling timbers behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My home!&rdquo; Charlotte peered through the darkness, but
could not see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or mine! Well, we&rsquo;ve got to get Kingsnorth out. His
will go down with him in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They struggled on&mdash;it seemed an interminable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>time&mdash;to Kingsnorth&rsquo;s piazza. They
realized instantly from its groanings and swayings that the house was
in immediate danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door is locked,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t make him hear in this rage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mac took Mac&rsquo;s big .45, deftly unloaded it, and slipped
the cartridges into the pocket of her mackintosh. With the heavy butt
she struck two or three blows on the lattice work of Kingsnorth&rsquo;s
shell windows. The opening made was large enough to admit her hand. She
slipped up the wooden latch which falls into place when a Filipino
sliding window is drawn to, and opened a casement. The lamp was burning
brightly on a table, and Kingsnorth, aroused by the noise and Mrs.
Maclaughlin&rsquo;s repeated calls, was rubbing his eyes and staring
dully at their faces in the aperture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; said Mrs. Maclaughlin sharply.
&ldquo;Come out of here. This house will go down in a
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Kingsnorth stupidly. It was
evident that he was not fully awake, but he staggered to his feet and
came to the open casement. A new blast came from the sea, and they felt
the floor heave under their feet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346"
href="#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maclaughlin, seizing
Charlotte&rsquo;s hand and dragging her backward along the veranda.
&ldquo;We have done what we could. O man! man! the door! the
door!&rdquo; For Kingsnorth was still fumbling with the window, pushing
back another shutter with the evident intention of getting out that
way. In the outstreaming glow of light, they saw the veranda supports
sway and heave. Then came a shriek in the air, a deafening roar, the
snap of powerful supports strained to breaking; and, as Kingsnorth
clambered heavily through the window, the same gust that tipped the
cottage over like a child&rsquo;s house of blocks, sent both women to
their faces on the wet ground.</p>
<p>Charlotte never could remember how long it was before she was
struggling to her feet, clambering over wrecked bamboo flooring,
calling aloud to the man, who, she, knew, must have gone down with the
house. Mrs. Maclaughlin was by her side, saying &ldquo;O my
Lord!&rdquo; at intervals. They could see a crimson glow waxing
brighter where the overturned petroleum lamp had set fire to the
wrecked house; but it was not till its light grew brilliant, that they
saw the man they sought. He seemed to be wedged between an upheaval of
the bamboo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>flooring and the leaning wall of the house. His
forehead was gashed and he was unconscious.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s training stood her well, and it was she who bent
over him and tried to lift him. She turned a white face, then, to Mrs.
Maclaughlin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A piece of bamboo has entered his side,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;We must break away these pieces and free him. He will be roasted
if we are not quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately the supports of the floor as well as the floor itself,
were of bamboo. At Charlotte&rsquo;s belt there hung her bunch of
housekeeper&rsquo;s keys, and a knife, not the ordinary penknife, but a
real household necessity, combining several domestic utensils. Mrs.
Maclaughlin owned one like it, and, in an instant, both women were
hacking at the stiff rattan fibres, working with frantic haste as the
dry <i>suali</i> lining of the house burst into roaring flame. They
tore away the long bamboo slats, but at the last, it was Charlotte who
drew out the broken piece which had entered Kingsnorth&rsquo;s breast.
He moved and groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he coming to?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Maclaughlin, peering but
not stopping. Charlotte shook her head. &ldquo;I hope not, yet,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;We must drag him back out of these ruins.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>By the glow of the burning dwelling, the two women, now dragging,
now lifting, took Kingsnorth out of the wreckage, and succeeded in
carrying him some fifty feet along the path that led to
Charlotte&rsquo;s home. There a clump of pandan bushes made a shelter
against the wind, which, as if satisfied with the havoc it had wrought,
ceased for fully five minutes. The crimson radiance of the fire lighted
the dripping bushes, cast its demon flickers on the ocean&rsquo;s rage,
and sent leaping shadows among the broken-stemmed cocoanut trees.
Charlotte gazed wearily in the direction of the native village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be asleep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t they come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Maclaughlin. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
not come; or, if they do, it will be with evil in their hearts.
They&rsquo;ve got two Japanese rogues to lead them, and they think Mac
and Martin have gone to the bottom; and when they find that this man is
disabled&mdash;&rdquo; She paused.</p>
<p>Charlotte took time only to groan as she bent over Kingsnorth,
wrapping a piece of cloth torn from her petticoat about his wounded
forehead, trying to pad the torn and bleeding breast. Blood and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>froth stood upon his lips and at times
convulsions of coughing seized him, and more froth and blood were
expelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is worse than disabled,&rdquo; said Charlotte slowly after
what examination she could make. &ldquo;I think the lung has been
penetrated. I am afraid he is dying.&rdquo; Mrs. Maclaughlin pressed
her lips together, but said nothing.</p>
<p>When Charlotte had done what she could, she sat down and took the
wounded man&rsquo;s head in her lap. The fire, which had blazed up so
valiantly, died out as it reached the wet roof, and another pattering
shower extinguished it. The night closed about them again in
impenetrable darkness. Only once, as the clouds drove past, a rift
showed for an instant, and a star beamed down upon them as if reminding
them that the world of former days was still there. Little by little,
the wind moderated, the showers ceased, and the wild harmonies of the
sea subsided into a long rhythmic booming of surf. In spite of its
violence, the wind was soft and warm as velvet, and though they were
damp, chilled, and uncomfortable, what they had undergone could not
have been called suffering. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 id="xd20e3368" class="main">Chapter XVIII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The mental suffering was, however, far from small. As
she strained her eyes through the blackness, Charlotte felt that the
weight of ages lay on their aching pupils. Fatigue, despair, and fear
all tore at her heart. There rose always before her the vision of
Martin as she had imagined him in the little coastguard steamer&rsquo;s
cabin, and the cold dread clenched her heart that the waves had sucked
him down and down to the bottomless sea, a lonely, dead thing in the
awful vastness of it. Once only she spoke to Mrs. Maclaughlin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it can be near morning?&rdquo; she asked; and
Mrs. Maclaughlin negatived the idea sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about midnight when we cleared out,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and time goes slowly in fixes like this.</p>
<p>It went infinitely worse than slowly. When, at last, the blackness
became a gloom filled with shapes, and a pallor showed in the east, the
two women, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>their hair in disorder, their faces drawn and
haggard, had hardly courage to look about them. Broad daylight revealed
a scene of desolation, with the sea running furiously against the
strewn beach, and with the cocoanut grove a ragged waste, its snapped
boles standing upright and the long plumy tops dragging on the ground.
Kingsnorth&rsquo;s charred structure, their own homes sprawling
drunkenly, and the distant village in ruins, presented a picture,
which, to minds less engrossed with even more heartrending
possibilities, would have meant despair.</p>
<p>With the first clear light, Mrs. Maclaughlin hunted up her basket of
food and some water bottles which she had deposited at the side of the
path, and each woman made a pretence of swallowing a few tinned
biscuit, and eased her parched throat with drink. Charlotte moistened
Kingsnorth&rsquo;s lips, but he seemed unable to swallow. After awhile,
however, he opened his eyes, and she perceived that he was
conscious.</p>
<p>He did not try to speak, but looked at her curiously, evidently
wondering how he came to be lying on the ground with his head in her
lap. He stared at her, nonplussed by her appearance, then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>slowly let his eyes travel about him. The
wrecked houses, the general devastation had, apparently, significance
but no recollection in his mind. He made a faint movement, but the pain
stopped him, and then she saw that he desired to speak but could
not.</p>
<p>Charlotte bent over him. &ldquo;You are hurt, Mr. Kingsnorth. I
don&rsquo;t think you can remember all that happened. After you went
home, the storm grew much worse, and finally Mrs. Maclaughlin and I
perceived that our houses were doomed. We went to your house and broke
in a window. You were asleep with a lamp burning on the table beside
you; we had some difficulty in awakening you; and when we succeeded,
and you roused yourself to come out, another blast of wind came. We had
barely time to spring back; but you went down with the house. It caught
fire from the lamp&mdash;but we got you out and dragged you here. I
have done what I could for your wounds.&rdquo; She stopped, a slight
vibration in her voice, and glanced desperately across the still
foaming sea. If help did not come to them, there was no hope for
Kingsnorth.</p>
<p>The man himself knit his brows in a forceful attempt at remembrance.
Little by little, the lines <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>of effort gave way to lines of
bitterness. His nostrils dilated, a slow painful flush deepened the
pallor of his face, and his lips tightened in a smile of self-contempt.
Her own eyes suffused with pity as she looked down on him, for she knew
that he had pieced it all out, and that the self-consciousness of
ultimate failure and debasement was overwhelming him. To be a man and
yet to have been found wanting at the supreme hour to those with whose
protection he had been charged was exceedingly bitter to John
Kingsnorth. He closed his eyes, unable to look at her, but presently a
tear forced its lonely way out, then another, and still another.</p>
<p>At the sight, the last shadow of her old distaste and resentment
vanished from Charlotte&rsquo;s mind. She saw in him only the creature
maimed and suffering, dignified by the near approach to the supreme
hour, a man weighted with the sense of failure, and the knowledge that
his last chance had come and gone, and that it, too, had passed him
unprofiting. With sudden tenderness,&mdash;a feeling that seemed to
reach forth to the uttermost confines of desolation,&mdash;she gently
wiped away the tears, and then, bending, kissed him on the brow.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>He smiled at her gratefully and spoke with
painful effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah that&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;ve been lonely, I&rsquo;ve
wanted a human hand in mine, a woman&rsquo;s of my own class. I&rsquo;m
not all hard and bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words came with the utmost difficulty, and she gently pressed
her fingers on his lips to stop him. His hand sought hers weakly, and
held her fingers there. Then he turned his face to her like a chidden
child, and she spoke to him no more. Only occasionally she moistened
his fevered lips or wiped away the bloody froth that lay upon them
after a fit of coughing. His physical suffering was very great, great
enough, she hoped, to dull the consciousness of his dangerous
state.</p>
<p>Mrs. Maclaughlin, as the day grew apace, busied herself in erecting
a low shelter over the dying man. She got some bamboo poles and stuck
them up, and laid on them a roof of banana leaves. She tried to get a
mattress out of one of the fallen houses, but was unable to do so. She
lighted a fire of leaves and old cocoanut husks, over which she brewed
a cup of strong coffee. Charlotte drank it gratefully and afterwards
ate one or two of the long fragrant bananas called
&ldquo;boongoolan.&rdquo; Although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355"
href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>she was greatly fatigued, the
hot drink and the food brought strength back to her, and new courage
animated her.</p>
<p>Their servants and the village folk came in curious groups to
inspect the ruined houses; but&mdash;sinister omen&mdash;they did not
approach the whites, but eyed them curiously from a distance. Charlotte
realized that, helpless as he was, Kingsnorth was still a protection to
them; and he knew it too, for once, when the Japanese diver came too
near, he motioned feebly for the revolver strapped at Charlotte&rsquo;s
waist. She gave it to him, smiling faintly. The Jap, however, beat a
retreat as the revolver changed hands.</p>
<p>So the long morning wore away and the dying man still pillowed his
head in Charlotte&rsquo;s lap. Her mind, as she looked down upon him,
was a-surge with crowding thoughts. Pity was foremost. It was indeed
pitiful, this slow, painful ending, in desolation and loneliness, of a
life that should have closed in dignity and peace. As the face grew
whiter, and the pinched look of death stole upon his features, the
bitterness and the degeneracy seemed to yield to what had been the once
lofty spirit of manhood before the corroding acids of life had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>preyed upon it. Step by step he had moved on the
narrowing path that ended in a <i>cul de sac</i>. He had declared that
the fault was his, and that if he had had the right stuff in him, he
could not have made the failure that he had made; but the poor fellow
had not selected the elements of his nature. They had been forged and
linked upon him by the wills and passions of others. Across the seas,
the mother who had contributed perhaps to the poorer elements of his
character, and who had chosen his father&mdash;that mother still lived
an easy luxurious life. Did she really think as little of him as he had
declared she did? Would no pangs of contrition for her selfishness
strike deep at the roots of her complacency, when she should learn that
her son had died an exile on the lonely island? The sisters who had
played with him, and the woman whose faithless hand had given the
impetus to his downward career&mdash;would no repentant pangs visit
them when the news should come that he had lived? There were other
women, too, as he had boasted; women who had loved him, in spite of his
scorn. Where were they? What were they doing as this final hour pressed
upon John Kingsnorth? Over in the Filipino village, the child who owed
him life <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>sported with his playthings, ignorant of the
father who would never act a father&rsquo;s part to him; and on the
sunny hillside mouldered the remains of the broken-hearted girl who had
been his wife. It was such a waste, such a pitiable, useless,
extravagant waste of human desire, and of human happiness; a life that
should have been filled with decency and respect and honor, ending so
meanly, so sordidly, beneath the shelter of a mere leaf-roofed hutch.
Her heart ached for the sufferer, ached for his isolation, for the
final hopeless ending of what he had once hoped would be an honorable
and happy career.</p>
<p>It was almost noon when Kingsnorth roused again and declared weakly
that he desired to make his will. In the pockets of the coat which she
had removed from him were a note book and pencil, and, at his
dictation, Charlotte scribbled down his wishes concerning the child
whom he at last stood ready to recognize. All his worldly possessions
were left to the orphan, and Collingwood was named as guardian.
Kingsnorth then signed the document, which both women witnessed. At his
request Charlotte once again pillowed his head in her lap, and he
kissed her hand feebly in gratitude. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Maclaughlin after a last hopeless look at the sea, threw
herself down in the shade of the pandan bushes and went to sleep.
Kingsnorth watched her jealously and when he was certain that she was
beyond listening or seeing, asked Charlotte for his tobacco pouch. She
hunted it up in the pockets of his coat, and gave it into his weak,
trembling hands. He fumbled with it; and at last drew out the pearl,
wrapped in tissue paper, which he had shown her on the day they
discussed Martin&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you,&rdquo; he said weakly; but at her flush, and sudden
impulsive gesture of protest, he went on more strongly; &ldquo;I want
you to have it. It means something&mdash;a beginning&mdash;something
between you and want. You&rsquo;re right: you must not sacrifice
yourself. You deserve something of life. But take&mdash;take with the
strong hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Kingsnorth,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I have not
told you, but I am not going away from Martin. I shall stay by him; he
needs me, I think. At any rate, there is some happiness in that
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frowned slightly, and then smiled. &ldquo;All the more need. A
woman ought not to be so utterly in a man&rsquo;s power. We&rsquo;re
merciless wretches&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href=
"#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>selfish.&rdquo; The effort of
speech seemed to be too great.</p>
<p>Seeing that to refuse him would cloud his dying hours, Charlotte
ceased to argue and let him press the bauble into her palm. It lay
there, the visible token of Kingsnorth&rsquo;s final allegiance to the
ideals of the class which he had once renounced. It was, as he had
declared, a something to stand between her and want, a bridge perhaps
in some hour of need, that thing which might furnish her with temporary
support and independence if she chose to set Martin Collingwood and her
marriage vows aside.</p>
<p>But she did not intend to do so. As the slow hours dragged by, that
resolution shaped itself more and more definitely in her mind, and with
it there fell away her old self-consciousness about the world&rsquo;s
opinion of her actions. Through what throes this sense of moral
independence had come to her, she knew; through what it might yet have
to pass before it could obtain a perfect development, she had some
intuition; but in her ultimate victory over the weaker and poorer
elements of her nature she had perfect confidence. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span></p>
<p>As she sat on in the blinding heat, her life passed in retrospect
before her, and something half bitterness, half elation sprang up in
her soul as she gazed upon it. Too clearly she perceived that its
noblest features had been those which had most obstructed the happiness
she yearned for. Her ideals, those maxims which parent, teachers, and
guardians alike had dinned in her ears as the guide-marks of life if
she would be a lovely and loveable woman, had only served to isolate
her from human kind; and so far as love and tenderness had come into
her life at all they were owing to a quality which all her training had
taught her to regard as, at best, a weakness, and at worst, a shame. A
flush of humiliation stained her cheek as she realized that her husband
had not loved her for her intelligence, for her truth, for her candor,
for her fair judgment, for her human charity, or for that final
tenderness of soul and spirit which she felt welling like some crystal
stream in her bosom. No, it was for her capacity for passion which his
ruder instincts had assumed must underlie the polished surface of her
mind. Judge Barton, too, had loved her, had striven to rouse in her an
answering feeling to his own; but though he had been able from the
first to put a proper value <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=
"#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>upon her breeding and
intelligence, she could not blind herself to the fact that these
attributes were mere accessories to what really attracted him&mdash;the
development, in herself, of amorous possibilities which only marriage
could have brought about. She knew incontrovertibly, that if, by a
magician&rsquo;s stroke, she could be changed back into the girl she
was when Alexander Barton first met her, his interest in her would fall
flat in an instant. That girl had been neither priggish nor
puritanical, only intelligent, full of ideals, and emotionally
immature, dedicated to that vision of womankind which man himself has
consciously created, but from which unconsciously he turns away,
chilled and rebuked by its very perfection.</p>
<p>As she looked back, she wondered at herself and at her own temerity
in having dared to break with the teachings of a life-time; in having
set at defiance all that tremendous pressure which custom, social
usage, family pride, and selfishness bring to bear upon a girl and her
marriage. It had taken a certain amount of moral courage to do what she
had done; it had taken still more to bear what she had borne. But if
out of endurance there came knowledge,&mdash;not empty maxims and high
sounding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>phrases, but real knowledge of her own strength
and of her own weaknesses, and some true guiding sense of her own
relationship to the thing we call life,&mdash;she grudged it as little
as the mother grudges the birth-pains which give her her child.</p>
<p>Had she taken her courage in her hand with one splendid outburst of
defiance, much of sorrow and of humiliation might have been spared her;
but, on the whole, she was glad that she had not done so. That sort of
courage is seldom moral; it is, at bottom, emotionalism. She had gone
timidly inch by inch trying to fortify each step by her intelligence.
The way had led through devious windings: it had been a trial of
endurance for others as well as for herself; but in the end it was she
who had come out benefited. Poor Martin (her eyes lighted tenderly) had
trodden it side by side with her; but experience had brought him no
enlightenment.</p>
<p>No: the real value of all those weeks of pain and humiliation had
been for herself. They had been a preparation for the revelation that
had come upon her of the false ideals which modern society gives women.
It was incomprehensible that a woman of brains could have clung
tenaciously to the ideal which she had cherished for twenty-eight
years; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>yet, all her training, all the influences which
surround a &ldquo;well-brought-up girl&rdquo; had contributed to it.
What she had asked for herself was a splendid nullity. She had expected
to draw her skirts daintily about her, and to pick her way through the
drawing-room of life, receiving all, giving nothing, too well-bred and
too intellectual to be tempted by its passions; and she had actually
supposed this egoistic solitude was moral elevation! She had thought
that trampling upon human love, setting aside the desire for home and
husband and children unless in their possession she gratified her
vanity and ambition, was self-respect! Well, she had not been alone in
her delusion. She knew that seventy per cent of her fellow women would
condemn her for having married Martin Collingwood, and that more than
that number would despise her for overlooking the crude insults of his
letter and of his speech by the pandan bushes. Her face flamed as she
recalled them. As long as she should live they would be a thorn in her
flesh, a scourge, an agony to be relived.</p>
<p>Yet no flagellant ever bent more meekly under his own blows than
Charlotte did as she resigned herself to bearing that cross. His words
had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>but the irrepressible utterance of his own
wounded vanity; his letter but the masterful outcropping of the
man&rsquo;s blind egoism. His illusions <i>versus</i> her
illusions!&mdash;after all, what more had divided them than that? But
greater than any illusion was life itself, the mingling of distracting
hopes, fears, emotions, out of which only one thing is permanent and
real, the consciousness of duty and right, as they are forever
separated from material advantages; the expression of the human soul,
which must move on struggling, fainting, vanquished or triumphant,
asking perhaps for sympathy here or understanding there, but in the end
recording its failures or its victories, companionless and
voiceless.</p>
<p>Often and often, during her weeks of torment, a phrase had crept
into her musings which she had repeated with God knows what of
bitterness: &ldquo;The years that the locust hath eaten.&rdquo; In the
clarity of her new-found light, it was those other years which the
locusts had eaten&mdash;those long, empty, undeveloping years in which
she had patterned herself on a social ideal; but which had brought her
nothing of strength or of character.</p>
<p>She went slowly over the year of her life on the island. What had
her association with the Maclaughlins <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>cost her? A possible
intimacy with a commissioner&rsquo;s wife. What had it brought her?
Much that was healthy in her viewpoint of life. That homely common
sense of Mrs. Maclaughlin, her outspoken dependence upon the man of her
choice, her frank admission of her sense of duty and obedience to him,
had a wholesome significance in these days, when women have thrown off
all the old maxims of subjection without finding any new self-imposed
obligations. What had her year&rsquo;s association with Kingsnorth,
educated reprobate, well-bred degenerate, cost her? An insulting
proposition from a worldly man; but what a wealth of human sympathy and
charity and compassion had it not injected into her moral and
intellectual exclusiveness! She felt the richening of her whole nature
that had come from putting aside her pride, from walking hand in hand
with an outcast upon the highway.</p>
<p>As for Judge Barton&rsquo;s little drama, it had not hurt her in the
least. Socially, it is true, it might be a stain. Even the semblance of
an &ldquo;affair&rdquo; with the respected dignitary might cause
gossip. But on her own soul that interview had left not one spot. It
had soiled nothing in her but her pride. She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>realized that it is not dodging the temptations
of life that makes character, but meeting them and resisting them. She
made up her mind that if fate should ever throw her again into the
society of Judge Barton, she would forgive him frankly; nor would she
seek to overwhelm him with her offended dignity, nor press upon him the
consciousness of his own sins. The man had had his moment of temptation
and had fallen. He had wronged no one but himself. Far be it from her
to decree his punishment.</p>
<p>Her thoughts turned then to Martin. The situation had its pathos for
him as well as for her, though perhaps he might never know it; for
there had come into the reality of her feeling for him the very
elements which his own egoism had most feared and hated. She had, in
the beginning loved him for loving&rsquo;s sake, caring nothing, so far
as she was concerned, for his faults and his weaknesses, only too
willing to ascribe to him the worth that he set upon himself; afraid of
the world, it is true, and hiding from its condemnation, but secretly
quarrelling with what she knew would be its contrary judgment. She had
married him because she needed him, because she leaned weakly upon him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>Now, when the experiences to which he had
subjected her had taught her to stand alone and to judge independently,
she was taking him back because he needed her.</p>
<p>He had declared that he would live with no woman on terms of pity or
of sufferance; but her heart was full of pity for him as it had never
been before; and for the first time the consciousness of her own real
superiority to Martin entered into her feeling for him. Up to that
hour, she had exalted him always at her own expense. There had been no
way of evading the weight of what she had felt to be the world&rsquo;s
scorn but determinedly to make Martin Collingwood into something which
he was not; in the moment of putting aside that world&rsquo;s verdict,
he and she swung as naturally into their normal relationships as a
compass needle swings back to its rest.</p>
<p>Henceforward she would see Collingwood as he was: the democrat whose
democracy is but the ladder of ambition, the raw, self-made man
reaching out an eager clutch for those finer things of life which he
knows only by their ticketed values. But that fact no longer weighted
him with a quality which needed apology or forgiveness; she saw in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>it growth, the only enduring, magnificent thing
in this universal scheme. In all nature what is there but growth and
decay, what but the steady effort to arrive at perfection, and the
ensuing death out of which come new life and effort? Blind man, with
Nature&rsquo;s unvarying lesson spread before him, seeks to defy in his
own being the law which can never be successfully defied; would seize
and hold unchanged that moment of perfect development which precedes
decadence; would make use of artificial distinctions, would endeavor to
strengthen class differences; would invent caste systems, and sell his
very soul to gratify his vain hope of retaining in himself or in his
immediate descendants what he feels as the highest expression of his
own development. He has never done it, he can never do it; but as
instinctively as the flower reaches up to the sunlight, so must he ever
struggle for the prolongation of his best matured product.</p>
<p>The question of Collingwood&rsquo;s social status became in an
instant trivial. She saw in him the new growth, vigorous, wholesome,
needing but the right soil and nourishment to develop into a forest
monarch; and she had in her the power to aid that growth, and she had
been minded to turn her back <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href=
"#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>upon him because he had not found
out what meed of consideration was due her, because he had sapped
unconsciously of her strength without asking himself why and whence it
came!</p>
<p>The thought broke upon her like a splendor, that there might be more
joy in helping Martin Collingwood to his perfected state than there
would be in just loving him or in being loved by him. Many times she
had repeated, as women are fond of doing, that threadbare
quotation,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Man&rsquo;s love is of man&rsquo;s life a thing
apart;</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Tis woman&rsquo;s whole existence!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and she had accepted the common feminine view that the
couplet is a testimonial to man&rsquo;s coarser nature, and a subtle
tribute to feminine &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and superiority. She saw in it
suddenly the whole story of feminine weakness and selfishness. She
honored Martin Collingwood that love had not been his whole existence.
There in her lap, his head swathed in bloody bandages, was gasping out
his life a man who, however manly he might have been in other respects,
had been essentially feminine in his disposition to make love his whole
existence; and who had felt that the thwarting of the one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>natural desire for the woman of his choice was
sufficient to dull all the normal manly instincts of ambition and
accomplishment.</p>
<p>She glanced about her at the evidences of ruin, and she bowed her
head in gratitude that it had been her lot to come to this primitive
land, to know humiliation and sorrow and loneliness, and to free
herself in its solitudes from the false ideals of her training. She
looked down the long vista of years and saw herself always at
Martin&rsquo;s side, helping, working with him, bearing with his
weaknesses, struggling with her own; but the end of it all was life and
character for them both, something bigger than mere loving or being
loved. If she uttered a sigh or two for what was irrevocably gone, it
was not wholly in regret. It was no dream life she was going back to,
no Summer in Arcady (that was past), but plain, prosaic marriage, with
disappointments and misunderstandings and misconceptions to be outlived
and to make the best of; nor was there anything but health in the
thought that Martin might find just as much to overlook as she might.
Children would come to them, and she saw herself bearing them, rearing
them, guiding into intelligent and ethical expression the forceful
inheritance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>which would be theirs from him, finding in them
the realization of her own will and soul expression, rejoicing in his
pride in them. He would work and she would bear,&mdash;strange anomaly
of fate that carried back to its primitive beginnings the product of so
much effort and vanity and ambition!</p>
<p>The sunshine beat pitilessly on the leaf shelter; the fatigue of the
long vigil told upon her; her crowding thoughts wearied her. She held
herself upright with difficulty, and her eyelids drooped. Sitting
unsupported, she slept.</p>
<p>Her own body falling forward roused her after the briefest of naps.
Her quick movement to regain her balance jarred Kingsnorth, and he
opened his eyes. His face was half turned to the sea, whereas her back
was set squarely against it; and he instantly perceived the long trail
of a steamer&rsquo;s smudge borne ahead of the vessel which was still
hull down. He pointed feebly to call her attention to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Martin,&rdquo; he murmured weakly. &ldquo;I
knew&mdash;he&mdash;would come. He&rsquo;s not&mdash;like&mdash; me.
He&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte stared, her eyes aglow, her face aflame with hope. She
lifted her hand to her throat, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372"
href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>choked by what was throbbing
there. There were hope and succor fast enough; but also what message of
despair might not that vessel bring? What if she, like Kingsnorth, had
delayed too long, and the Unseen Powers had decreed there should be no
more chances for her? Then as she glanced down, she met
Kingsnorth&rsquo;s intent eyes, puzzled, their keen intelligence
slightly dimmed, but full of some question that he dared not ask. A
sudden impulse moved her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you before it is too late,&rdquo; she said
with difficulty, &ldquo;just how I feel. I glory in Martin Collingwood;
I am glad I am his wife. I have had the indecency to be ashamed of
myself for the most human and womanly thing I ever did in my life.
Well, I&rsquo;m emancipated.&rdquo; She stopped, drew a long breath,
and broke into a little, low, nervous laugh. &ldquo;There seems to be
growing up a conviction among women that the only door of emancipation
is the divorce court, and that the only way to assert their personality
is in insurrection. I don&rsquo;t want that door. I had the effrontery
to marry Martin Collingwood to be adored&mdash;as if either he or I or
anybody else has the right to make <i>that</i> the end of life. That is
the cry of the effete, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href=
"#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>of the thing which must soon fall
into decay. But Heaven helping me, I&rsquo;m going to make myself into
a woman, and I&rsquo;m going to be the right influence in his life.
It&rsquo;s not going to be easy or free from heartache, but we&rsquo;ll
do it.&rdquo; A sudden recollection overcame her. Her bravery dropped
from her, the light vanished from her eye. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t too
late,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Kingsnorth said, though some torment, physical
or mental, twisted his lips into uncouth shapes as he dragged out the
words. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come. Almighty God wouldn&rsquo;t keep a
man&mdash;from this.&rdquo; With which words, of a poetic consistency
with the weakness which had been his undoing, the voice of John
Kingsnorth fell into eternal silence. For half an hour longer, perhaps,
his eyes remained open, staring curiously, wistfully, sometimes at her
face, sometimes at the deepening vapor line upon the sky. The steamer
came full into view, a coastguard boat, undoubtedly heading for the
island. The day&rsquo;s heat diminished; the shadows lengthened; the
sea ran more and more gently; and the light of late afternoon deepened
to etherealized amber. Its magic seemed to bring peace and resignation
to the dying man. Once again with a pathetic sigh he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>turned his face to hers and tried to nestle
closer to her as a penitent child clings to the mother who has
conquered him. She bent and kissed him again, this time upon the lips.
Shortly after, she perceived that he was unconscious.</p>
<p>Still the labored breathing went on and on a long time,&mdash;time
enough for their servants to gather, a meek and hospitable group some
little distance away, watching the vessel which would restore the
whites to their old status on the island; time enough for the steamer
to drop her anchor and to put out a boat; but at last, in a long
shuddering sigh, it ceased. John Kingsnorth, disreputable offspring of
a proud family, had gone to his reckoning. In time they would go to
theirs.</p>
<p>For a few minutes, Charlotte made no attempt to move. Then she
gently laid him down, and without disturbing Mrs. Maclaughlin still in
the deep sleep of exhaustion, dragged herself painfully to her feet.
The movement dislodged the pearl, which had slipped unnoticed into her
lap. She picked it up and stood looking upon it meditatively. Its
luster had no sinister significance in spite of those rather revolting
confessions of Kingsnorth&rsquo;s about his musings over it. It was
just a beautiful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375"
name="pb375">375</a>]</span>bauble, one of those shining gauds for
which women break their hearts or with which they seek to break other
women&rsquo;s. It had no worth apart from human vanity. Back of all its
commercial value, lay a human weakness.</p>
<p>She did not care for it. She said to herself that she would keep it
long enough to learn the news that the boat brought her. If Martin was
alive, well she knew how quickly he would repudiate the gift, how his
man&rsquo;s pride would revolt at her having financial independence of
him. She could not but realize how utterly his own self-respect must
hang on his power to work for her, to give her the things he wanted for
her. Nor did she wish to repeat to him what Kingsnorth had told her. It
was a confession he would not willingly have made to Collingwood; it
was the woman in him crying out to the woman. But if Martin was no
more, then she would accept the gift, thankful for the help it would
give her, knowing well that Martin would not have grudged it.</p>
<p>Stiffly she made her way to the beach and shading her eyes, peered
at the approaching boat. The dazzle of the sunset was in them and the
boat was well out; but someone was standing, waving frantic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>arms at her. Her heart gave one great throb as
she realized that no one but Martin would so energetically have
welcomed the sight of her; and then as it came nearer and she saw him
plainly, the throbs settled into steady, confident beating. Her chance
had come, and would find her ready to profit.</p>
<p>The sea was molten metal shot with undertones of steely blue and
opal; huge banks of cloud were massed on the distant horizon, the
hidden sun pouring down great shafts of light; cocoanut trees were
yellow green in the radiance; the worn, mouse-colored nipa roofs were
turned to gold. All nature was afire with beauty and promise. Yet there
in the dismantled homes lay a man&rsquo;s work to his hand; and in the
general devastation was written the story of wreck and of failure, the
threat of toil to restore. There, too, in the full light stood a woman
ready to help and to bear unflinchingly her share of the burden. Her
dress was disordered; her hair, that had grayed slightly in the
suffering of past weeks, had something of wildness in its untidiness.
Her face was white, and would never again be youthful; but in spite of
fatigue she stood erect, magnificent, a splendor of purpose in her
eyes, a woman entered into her heritage, tried, self-confident, sure of
herself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>Though he would never know it, though he was
destined to go on to the end in his fool&rsquo;s paradise of
indomitable ignorance, Martin Collingwood, most masculine of masculine
types, who had vowed that no woman should ever rule him or patronize
him, accepted, in that hour, the terms he had repudiated, and thrust
his neck rapturously, for all time, beneath the yoke of petticoat
government.</p>
<p>Collingwood and Maclaughlin were both on their feet, the one
feasting his eyes on the woman he loved, the other searching with dread
premonition of evil for the form dear to him. Neither at that moment
gave a thought to the destruction that had overtaken what they had
built, or to the tedious steps to be retraced, the effort of
accomplishment to be re-done. That was for later; that was life in
their sturdy acceptation of it. But just before the boat grounded they
saw Charlotte lift one hand with an easy graceful movement and toss
some gleaming object into the sea. They even heard the tiny splash it
made, and saw the ripples. Neither gave it a second thought; it might
have been a pebble picked from the beach, or some equally valueless
trifle. Little did Martin dream that it was the last fagot she
possessed laid upon the altar of his self-esteem. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the boat&rsquo;s keel grated on the sands, however, both men
sprang out and splashed their way to her. She stood smiling clearly,
steadfastly, into her husband&rsquo;s eyes; and as he gathered her with
a sob into his arms, Maclaughlin, obedient to her slight gesture, tore
past them to the low-roofed shelter whither she motioned him.
Collingwood, raising his eyes as he lifted his lips from his
wife&rsquo;s, saw the man&rsquo;s abrupt halt and recoil; then beheld
him uncover at the sight of the sleeping woman and their dead
comrade.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
